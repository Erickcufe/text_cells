AB  - The amyloid hypothesis for Alzheimer's disease (AD) posits a neuron-centric, linear 
      cascade initiated by Aβ and leading to dementia. This direct causality is 
      incompatible with clinical observations. We review evidence supporting a long, 
      complex cellular phase consisting of feedback and feedforward responses of 
      astrocytes, microglia, and vasculature. The field must incorporate this holistic 
      view and take advantage of advances in single-cell approaches to resolve the 
      critical junctures at which perturbations initially amenable to compensatory 
      feedback transform into irreversible, progressive neurodegeneration.

AB  - Extensive evidence has indicated that the breakdown of myelin is associated with 
      Alzheimer's disease (AD) since the vulnerability of oligodendrocytes under 
      Alzheimer's pathology easily induces the myelin breakdown and the loss of the myelin 
      sheath which might be the initiating step in the changes of the earliest stage of AD 
      prior to appearance of amyloid and tau pathology. Considerable research implicated 
      that beta-amyloid (Aβ)-mediated oligodendrocyte dysfunction and myelin breakdown may 
      be via neuroinflammation, oxidative stress and/or apoptosis. It also seems that the 
      oligodendrocyte dysfunction is triggered by the formation of neurofibrillary tangles 
      (NFTs) through inflammation and oxidative stress as the common pathophysiological 
      base. Impaired repair of oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) might possibly 
      enhance the disease progress under decreased self-healing ability from aging process 
      and pathological factors including Aβ pathology and/or NFTs. Thus, these results 
      have suggested that targeting oligodendrocytes may be a novel therapeutic 
      intervention for the prevention and treatment of AD.

AB  - Oligodendrocytes are the myelinating cells of the central nervous system (CNS) that 
      are generated from oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPC). OPC are distributed 
      throughout the CNS and represent a pool of migratory and proliferative adult 
      progenitor cells that can differentiate into oligodendrocytes. The central function 
      of oligodendrocytes is to generate myelin, which is an extended membrane from the 
      cell that wraps tightly around axons. Due to this energy consuming process and the 
      associated high metabolic turnover oligodendrocytes are vulnerable to cytotoxic and 
      excitotoxic factors. Oligodendrocyte pathology is therefore evident in a range of 
      disorders including multiple sclerosis, schizophrenia and Alzheimer's disease. 
      Deceased oligodendrocytes can be replenished from the adult OPC pool and lost myelin 
      can be regenerated during remyelination, which can prevent axonal degeneration and 
      can restore function. Cell population studies have recently identified novel 
      immunomodulatory functions of oligodendrocytes, the implications of which, e.g., for 
      diseases with primary oligodendrocyte pathology, are not yet clear. Here, we review 
      the journey of oligodendrocytes from the embryonic stage to their role in 
      homeostasis and their fate in disease. We will also discuss the most common models 
      used to study oligodendrocytes and describe newly discovered functions of 
      oligodendrocytes.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is conceptualized as a progressive consequence of two 
      hallmark pathological changes in grey matter: extracellular amyloid plaques and 
      neurofibrillary tangles. However, over the past several years, neuroimaging studies 
      have implicated micro- and macrostructural abnormalities in white matter in the risk 
      and progression of AD, suggesting that in addition to the neuronal pathology 
      characteristic of the disease, white matter degeneration and demyelination may be 
      also important pathophysiological features. Here we review the evidence for white 
      matter abnormalities in AD with a focus on myelin and oligodendrocytes, the only 
      source of myelination in the central nervous system, and discuss the relationship 
      between white matter changes and the hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease. We review 
      several mechanisms such as ischemia, oxidative stress, excitotoxicity, iron 
      overload, Aβ toxicity and tauopathy, which could affect oligodendrocytes. We 
      conclude that white matter abnormalities, and in particular myelin and 
      oligodendrocytes, could be mechanistically important in AD pathology and could be 
      potential treatment targets.

AB  - Oligodendrocytes form the myelin that ensheaths CNS axons, which is essential for 
      rapid neuronal signalling and underpins the massive computing power of the human 
      brain. Oligodendrocytes and myelin also provide metabolic and trophic support for 
      axons and their disruption results in axonal demise and neurodegeneration, which are 
      key features of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Notably, the brain has a remarkable 
      capacity for regenerating oligodendrocytes, which is the function of adult 
      oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) or NG2-glia. White matter loss is 
      often among the earliest brain changes in AD, preceding the tangles and plaques that 
      characterize neuronal deficits. The underlying causes of myelin loss include 
      oxidative stress, neuroinflammation and excitotoxicity, associated with accumulation 
      of Aβ and tau hyperphosphorylation, pathological hallmarks of AD. Moreover, there is 
      evidence that NG2-glia are disrupted in AD, which may be associated with disruption 
      of synaptic signalling. This has led to the hypothesis that a vicious cycle of 
      myelin loss and failure of regeneration from NG2-glia plays a key role in AD. 
      Therapies that target NG2-glia are likely to have positive effects on myelination 
      and neuroprotection in AD.

AB  - Advances in neuroimaging have enabled greater understanding of the progression of 
      cerebral degenerative processes associated with ageing-related dementias. 
      Leukoaraiosis or rarefied white matter (WM) originally described on computed 
      tomography is one of the most prominent changes which occurs in older age. White 
      matter hyperintensities (WMH) evident on magnetic resonance imaging have become 
      commonplace to describe WM changes in relation to cognitive dysfunction, types of 
      stroke injury, cerebral small vessel disease and neurodegenerative disorders 
      including Alzheimer's disease. Substrates of WM degeneration collectively include 
      myelin loss, axonal abnormalities, arteriolosclerosis and parenchymal changes 
      resulting from lacunar infarcts, microinfarcts, microbleeds and perivascular 
      spacing. WM cells incorporating astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, pericytes and 
      microglia are recognized as key cellular components of the gliovascular unit. They 
      respond to ongoing pathological processes in different ways leading to disruption of 
      the gliovascular unit. The most robust alterations involve oligodendrocyte loss and 
      astrocytic clasmatodendrosis with displacement of the water channel protein, 
      aquaporin 4. These modifications likely precede arteriolosclerosis and capillary 
      degeneration and involve tissue oedema, breach of the blood-brain barrier and 
      induction of a chronic hypoxic state in the deep WM. Several pathophysiological 
      mechanisms are proposed to explain how WM changes commencing with haemodynamic 
      changes within the vascular system impact on cognitive dysfunction. Animal models 
      simulating cerebral hypoperfusion in man have paved the way for several 
      translational opportunities. Various compounds with variable efficacies have been 
      tested to reduce oxidative stress, inflammation and blood-brain barrier damage in 
      the WM. Our review demonstrates that WM degeneration encompasses multiple substrates 
      and therefore more than one pharmacological approach is necessary to preserve axonal 
      function and prevent cognitive impairment. This article is part of the Special Issue 
      "Vascular Dementia".

PG  - 142-152

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Microvascular brain injury (mVBI) is a common pathological correlate of 
      vascular contributions to cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID) that leads to 
      white matter (WM) injury (WMI). VCID appears to arise from chronic recurrent white 
      matter ischemia that triggers oxidative stress and an increase in total 
      oligodendrocyte lineage cells. We hypothesized that mVBI involves vasodilator 
      dysfunction of white matter penetrating arterioles and aberrant oligodendrocyte 
      progenitor cell (OPC) responses to WMI. METHODS: We analyzed cases of mVBI with low 
      Alzheimer's disease neuropathological change in prefrontal cortex WM from rapid 
      autopsies in a population-based cohort where VCID frequently occurs. Arteriolar 
      vasodilator function was quantified by videomicroscopy. OPC maturation was 
      quantified using lineage specific markers. RESULTS: Acetylcholine-mediated 
      arteriolar dilation in mVBI was significantly reduced in WM penetrators relative to 
      pial arterioles. Astrogliosis-defined WMI was positively associated with increased 
      OPCs and was negatively associated with decreased mature oligodendrocytes. 
      INTERPRETATION: Selectively impaired vasodilator function of WM penetrating 
      arterioles in mVBI occurs in association with aberrant differentiation of OPCs in 
      WMI, which supports that myelination disturbances in VCID are related to disrupted 
      maturation of myelinating oligodendrocytes. Ann Neurol 2018;83:142-152.

AB  - In Lewy body diseases-including Parkinson's disease, without or with dementia, 
      dementia with Lewy bodies, and Alzheimer's disease with Lewy body co-pathology (1) 
      -α-synuclein (α-Syn) aggregates in neurons as Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites (2) . By 
      contrast, in multiple system atrophy α-Syn accumulates mainly in oligodendrocytes as 
      glial cytoplasmic inclusions (GCIs) (3) . Here we report that pathological α-Syn in 
      GCIs and Lewy bodies (GCI-α-Syn and LB-α-Syn, respectively) is conformationally and 
      biologically distinct. GCI-α-Syn forms structures that are more compact and it is 
      about 1,000-fold more potent than LB-α-Syn in seeding α-Syn aggregation, consistent 
      with the highly aggressive nature of multiple system atrophy. GCI-α-Syn and LB-α-Syn 
      show no cell-type preference in seeding α-Syn pathology, which raises the question 
      of why they demonstrate different cell-type distributions in Lewy body disease 
      versus multiple system atrophy. We found that oligodendrocytes but not neurons 
      transform misfolded α-Syn into a GCI-like strain, highlighting the fact that 
      distinct α-Syn strains are generated by different intracellular milieus. Moreover, 
      GCI-α-Syn maintains its high seeding activity when propagated in neurons. Thus, 
      α-Syn strains are determined by both misfolded seeds and intracellular environments.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: In looking for novel non-amyloid-based etiologies for Alzheimer's 
      disease, we explore the hypothesis that age-related myelin loss is an attractive 
      explanation for age-associated cognitive decline and dementia. METHODS: We performed 
      a meta-analysis of data in the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center database 
      accompanied by quantitative histopathology of myelin and oligodendrocytes (OLs) in 
      frontal cortices of 24 clinically characterized individuals. Pathological findings 
      were further validated in an Alzheimer's disease mouse model and in culture. 
      RESULTS: Myelin lesions increased with cognitive impairment in an 
      amyloid-independent fashion with signs of degeneration appearing before neuronal 
      loss. Myelinating OLs in the gray matter showed greater vulnerability than those in 
      white matter, and the degenerative changes correlated with evidence of DNA damage. 
      Similar results were found in myelinating OL cultures where DNA damage caused 
      aberrant OL cell cycle re-entry and death. DISCUSSION: We present the first 
      comprehensive analysis of the cell biology of early myelin loss in sporadic 
      Alzheimer's disease.

TI  - Pericyte degeneration causes white matter dysfunction in the mouse central nervous 
      system.
PG  - 326-337
LID - 10.1038/nm.4482 [doi]
AB  - Diffuse white-matter disease associated with small-vessel disease and dementia is 
      prevalent in the elderly. The biological mechanisms, however, remain elusive. Using 
      pericyte-deficient mice, magnetic resonance imaging, viral-based tract-tracing, and 
      behavior and tissue analysis, we found that pericyte degeneration disrupted 
      white-matter microcirculation, resulting in an accumulation of toxic blood-derived 
      fibrin(ogen) deposits and blood-flow reductions, which triggered a loss of myelin, 
      axons and oligodendrocytes. This disrupted brain circuits, leading to white-matter 
      functional deficits before neuronal loss occurs. Fibrinogen and fibrin fibrils 
      initiated autophagy-dependent cell death in oligodendrocyte and pericyte cultures, 
      whereas pharmacological and genetic manipulations of systemic fibrinogen levels in 
      pericyte-deficient, but not control mice, influenced the degree of white-matter 
      fibrin(ogen) deposition, pericyte degeneration, vascular pathology and white-matter 
      changes. Thus, our data indicate that pericytes control white-matter structure and 
      function, which has implications for the pathogenesis and treatment of human 
      white-matter disease associated with small-vessel disease.

      Implications in the Pathogenesis of Alzheimer's Disease.

AB  - Significant knowledge about the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been 
      gained in the last century; however, the understanding of its causes of onset 
      remains limited. Late-onset AD is observed in about 95% of patients, and 
      APOE4-encoding apolipoprotein E4 (ApoE4) is strongly associated with these cases. As 
      an apolipoprotein, the function of ApoE in brain cholesterol transport has been 
      extensively studied and widely appreciated. Development of new technologies such as 
      human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) and CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing tools 
      have enabled us to develop human brain model systems in vitro and readily manipulate 
      genomic information. In the context of these advances, recent studies provide strong 
      evidence that abnormal cholesterol metabolism by ApoE4 could be linked to 
      AD-associated pathology. In this review, we discuss novel discoveries in brain 
      cholesterol dysregulation by ApoE4. We further elaborate cell type-specific roles in 
      cholesterol regulation of four major brain cell types, neurons, astrocytes, 
      microglia, and oligodendrocytes, and how its dysregulation can be linked to AD 
      pathology.

AB  - Multiple system atrophy (MSA) is a rare and fatal neurodegenerative disorder 
      characterized by a variable combination of parkinsonism, cerebellar impairment, and 
      autonomic dysfunction. The pathologic hallmark is the accumulation of aggregated 
      α-synuclein in oligodendrocytes, forming glial cytoplasmic inclusions, which 
      qualifies MSA as a synucleinopathy together with Parkinson's disease and dementia 
      with Lewy bodies. The underlying pathogenesis is still not well understood. Some 
      symptomatic treatments are available, whereas neuroprotection remains an urgent 
      unmet treatment need. In this review, we critically appraise significant 
      developments of the past decade with emphasis on pathogenesis, diagnosis, prognosis, 
      and treatment development. We further discuss unsolved questions and highlight some 
      perspectives. © 2019 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.

AB  - The dynamics of CNS function rely upon omnidirectional communication among CNS cell 
      types. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) have emerged as key mediators of this 
      communication and are actively involved in response to CNS injury, mediating 
      inflammatory response and inflammation-related neuroprotection as they display dual 
      beneficial and detrimental roles. Neuroimmune interactions include communication 
      between neurons and microglia, the resident macrophages within the CNS, and these 
      interactions are a critical mediator of healthy brain functions, mounting an 
      inflammatory response, and disease pathogenesis. This review aims to organize recent 
      research highlighting the role of EVs in health and neurodegenerative disorders, 
      with a specific focus on neuroimmune interactions between neurons and glia in 
      Alzheimer's disease.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Astrocytes, also called astroglia, maintain homoeostasis of the brain by 
      providing trophic and metabolic support to neurons. They recycle neurotransmitters, 
      stimulate synaptogenesis and synaptic neurotransmission, form part of the 
      blood-brain barrier, and regulate regional blood flow. Although astrocytes have been 
      known to display morphological alterations in Alzheimer's disease for more than a 
      century, research has remained neurocentric. Emerging evidence suggests that these 
      morphological changes reflect functional alterations that affect disease. RECENT 
      DEVELOPMENTS: Genetic studies indicate that most of the risk of developing late 
      onset Alzheimer's disease, the most common form of the disease, affecting patients 
      aged 65 years and older, is associated with genes (ie, APOE, APOJ, and SORL) that 
      are mainly expressed by glial cells (ie, astrocytes, microglia, and 
      oligodendrocytes). This insight has moved the focus of research away from neurons 
      and towards glial cells and neuroinflammation. Molecular studies in rodent models 
      suggest a direct contribution of astrocytes to neuroinflammatory and 
      neurodegenerative processes causing Alzheimer's disease; however, these models might 
      insufficiently mimic the human disease, because rodent astrocytes differ 
      considerably in morphology, functionality, and gene expression. In-vivo studies 
      using stem-cell derived human astrocytes are allowing exploration of the human 
      disease and providing insights into the neurotoxic or protective contributions of 
      these cells to the pathogenesis of disease. The first attempts to develop astrocytic 
      biomarkers and targeted therapies are emerging. WHERE NEXT?: Single-cell 
      transcriptomics allows the fate of individual astrocytes to be followed in situ and 
      provides the granularity needed to describe healthy and pathological cellular states 
      at different stages of Alzheimer's disease. Given the differences between human and 
      rodent astroglia, study of human cells in this way will be crucial. Although refined 
      single-cell transcriptomic analyses of human post-mortem brains are important for 
      documentation of pathology, they only provide snapshots of a dynamic reality. Thus, 
      functional work studying human astrocytes generated from stem cells and exposed to 
      pathological conditions in rodent brain or cell culture are needed to understand the 
      role of these cells in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. These studies will 
      lead to novel biomarkers and hopefully a series of new drug targets to tackle this 
      disease.

AB  - Myelination is a recent evolutionary addition that significantly enhances the speed 
      of transmission in the neural network. Even slight defects in myelin integrity 
      impair performance and enhance the risk of neurological disorders. Indeed, myelin 
      degeneration is an early and well-recognized neuropathology that is age associated, 
      but appears before cognitive decline. Myelin is only formed by fully differentiated 
      oligodendrocytes, but the entire oligodendrocyte lineage are clear targets of the 
      altered chemistry of the aging brain. As in neurons, unrepaired DNA damage 
      accumulates in the postmitotic oligodendrocyte genome during normal aging, and 
      indeed may be one of the upstream causes of cellular aging - a fact well illustrated 
      by myelin co-morbidity in premature aging syndromes arising from deficits in DNA 
      repair enzymes. The clinical and experimental evidence from Alzheimer's disease, 
      progeroid syndromes, ataxia-telangiectasia and other conditions strongly suggest 
      that oligodendrocytes may in fact be uniquely vulnerable to oxidative DNA damage. If 
      this damage remains unrepaired, as is increasingly true in the aging brain, myelin 
      gene transcription and oligodendrocyte differentiation is impaired. Delineating the 
      relationships between early myelin loss and DNA damage in brain aging will offer an 
      additional dimension outside the neurocentric view of neurodegenerative disease.

AB  - Glia have been implicated in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. Variants of the 
      microglia receptor triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) increase 
      AD risk, and activation of disease-associated microglia (DAM) is dependent on TREM2 
      in mouse models of AD. We surveyed gene-expression changes associated with AD 
      pathology and TREM2 in 5XFAD mice and in human AD by single-nucleus RNA sequencing. 
      We confirmed the presence of Trem2-dependent DAM and identified a previously 
      undiscovered Serpina3n(+)C4b(+) reactive oligodendrocyte population in mice. 
      Interestingly, remarkably different glial phenotypes were evident in human AD. 
      Microglia signature was reminiscent of IRF8-driven reactive microglia in 
      peripheral-nerve injury. Oligodendrocyte signatures suggested impaired axonal 
      myelination and metabolic adaptation to neuronal degeneration. Astrocyte profiles 
      indicated weakened metabolic coordination with neurons. Notably, the reactive 
      phenotype of microglia was less evident in TREM2-R47H and TREM2-R62H carriers than 
      in non-carriers, demonstrating a TREM2 requirement in both mouse and human AD, 
      despite the marked species-specific differences.

TI  - Glial Cells - The Key Elements of Alzheimer´s Disease.
PG  - 894-911
AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder with major clinical 
      hallmarks of memory loss, dementia, and cognitive impairment. Besides the extensive 
      neuron-oriented research, an increasing body of evidence suggests that glial cells, 
      namely astrocytes, microglia, NG2 glia and oligodendrocytes, may play an important 
      role in the pathogenesis of this disease. In the first part of this review, AD 
      pathophysiology in humans is briefly described and compared with disease progression 
      in routinely used animal models. The relevance of findings obtained in animal models 
      of AD is also discussed with respect to AD pathology in humans. Further, this review 
      summarizes recent findings regarding the role/participation of glial cells in 
      pathogenesis of AD, focusing on changes in their morphology, functions, proteins and 
      gene expression profiles. As for astrocytes and microglia, they are fundamental for 
      the progression and outcome of AD either because they function as effector cells 
      releasing cytokines that play a role in neuroprotection, or because they fail to 
      fulfill their homeostatic functions, ultimately leaving neurons to face 
      excitotoxicity and oxidative stress. Next, we turn our attention towards NG2 glia, a 
      novel and distinct class of glial cells in the central nervous system (CNS), whose 
      role in a variety of human CNS diseases has begun to emerge, and we also consider 
      the participation of oligodendrocytes in the pathogenesis and progression of AD. 
      Since AD is currently an incurable disease, in the last part of our review we 
      hypothesize about possible glia-oriented treatments and provide a perspective of 
      possible future advancements in this field.

PG  - 369-379
LID - 10.1042/CS20160618 [doi]
AB  - Cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) is a prevalent, neurological disease that 
      significantly increases the risk of stroke and dementia. The main pathological 
      changes are vascular, in the form of lipohyalinosis and arteriosclerosis, and in the 
      white matter (WM), in the form of WM lesions. Despite this, it is unclear to what 
      extent the key cell types involved-the endothelial cells (ECs) of the vasculature 
      and the oligodendrocytes of the WM-interact. Here, we describe the work that has so 
      far been carried out suggesting an interaction between ECs and oligodendrocytes in 
      SVD. As these interactions have been studied in more detail in other disease states 
      and in development, we explore these systems and discuss the role these mechanisms 
      may play in SVD.

TI  - TREM2 sustains microglial expansion during aging and response to demyelination.
PG  - 2161-70
LID - 77983 [pii]
LID - 10.1172/JCI77983 [doi]
AB  - Microglia contribute to development, homeostasis, and immunity of the CNS. Like 
      other tissue-resident macrophage populations, microglia express the surface receptor 
      triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2), which binds polyanions, 
      such as dextran sulphate and bacterial LPS, and activates downstream signaling 
      cascades through the adapter DAP12. Individuals homozygous for inactivating 
      mutations in TREM2 exhibit demyelination of subcortical white matter and a lethal 
      early onset dementia known as Nasu-Hakola disease. How TREM2 deficiency mediates 
      demyelination and disease is unknown. Here, we addressed the basis for this genetic 
      association using Trem2(-/-) mice. In WT mice, microglia expanded in the corpus 
      callosum with age, whereas aged Trem2(-/-) mice had fewer microglia with an abnormal 
      morphology. In the cuprizone model of oligodendrocyte degeneration and 
      demyelination, Trem2(-/-) microglia failed to amplify transcripts indicative of 
      activation, phagocytosis, and lipid catabolism in response to myelin damage. As a 
      result, Trem2(-/-) mice exhibited impaired myelin debris clearance, axonal 
      dystrophy, oligodendrocyte reduction, and persistent demyelination after prolonged 
      cuprizone treatment. Moreover, myelin-associated lipids robustly triggered TREM2 
      signaling in vitro, suggesting that TREM2 may directly sense lipid components 
      exposed during myelin damage. We conclude that TREM2 is required for promoting 
      microglial expansion during aging and microglial response to insults of the white 
      matter.

TI  - Familial t(1;11) translocation is associated with disruption of white matter 
      structural integrity and oligodendrocyte-myelin dysfunction.

AB  - Although the underlying neurobiology of major mental illness (MMI) remains unknown, 
      emerging evidence implicates a role for oligodendrocyte-myelin abnormalities. Here, 
      we took advantage of a large family carrying a balanced t(1;11) translocation, which 
      substantially increases risk of MMI, to undertake both diffusion tensor imaging and 
      cellular studies to evaluate the consequences of the t(1;11) translocation on white 
      matter structural integrity and oligodendrocyte-myelin biology. This translocation 
      disrupts among others the DISC1 gene which plays a crucial role in brain 
      development. We show that translocation-carrying patients display significant 
      disruption of  white matter integrity compared with familial controls. At a cellular 
      level, we observe dysregulation of key pathways controlling oligodendrocyte 
      development and morphogenesis in induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) derived case 
      oligodendrocytes. This is associated with reduced proliferation and a stunted 
      morphology in vitro. Further, myelin internodes in a humanized mouse model that 
      recapitulates the human translocation as well as after transplantation of t(1;11) 
      oligodendrocyte progenitors were significantly reduced when  compared with controls. 
      Thus we provide evidence that the t(1;11) translocation has biological effects at 
      both the systems and cellular level that together suggest oligodendrocyte-myelin 
      dysfunction.

AB  - It is now relatively well accepted that the cerebrovascular system does not merely 
      provide inert pipes for blood delivery to the brain. Cerebral endothelial cells may 
      compose an embedded bunker of trophic factors that contribute to brain homeostasis 
      and function. Recent findings suggest that soluble factors from cerebral endothelial 
      cells nourish neighboring cells, such as neurons and astrocytes. Although data are 
      strongest in supporting mechanisms of endothelial-neuron and/or 
      endothelial-astrocyte trophic coupling, it is likely that similar interactions also 
      exist between cerebral endothelial cells and oligodendrocyte lineage cells. In this 
      mini-review, we summarize current advances in the field of 
      endothelial-oligodendrocyte trophic coupling. These endothelial-oligodendrocyte 
      interactions may comprise the oligovascular niche to maintain their cellular 
      functions and sustain ongoing angiogenesis/oligodendrogenesis. Importantly, it 
      should be noted that the cell-cell interactions are not static-the trophic coupling 
      is disturbed under acute phase after brain injury, but would be recovered in the 
      chronic phase to promote brain remodeling and repair. Oligodendrocyte lineage cells 
      play critical roles in white matter function, and under pathological conditions, 
      oligodendrocyte dysfunction lead to white matter damage. Therefore, a deeper 
      understanding of the mechanisms of endothelial-oligodendrocyte trophic coupling may 
      lead to new therapeutic approaches for white matter-related diseases, such as stroke 
      or vascular dementia.

TI  - Myelin oligodendrocyte basic protein and prognosis in behavioral-variant 
      frontotemporal dementia.
PG  - 502-9
LID - 10.1212/WNL.0000000000000668 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the prognostic utility of tauopathy-associated single 
      nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in sporadic behavioral-variant frontotemporal 
      dementia (bvFTD). METHODS: Eighty-one patients with sporadic bvFTD were genotyped 
      for tauopathy-associated SNPs at rs8070723 (microtubule-associated protein tau 
      [MAPT]) and rs1768208 (myelin-associated oligodendrocyte basic protein [MOBP]). We 
      performed a retrospective case-control study comparing age at onset and disease 
      duration between carriers of ≥1 polymorphism allele and noncarriers for these SNPs. 
      Subanalyses were performed for autopsied subgroups with tauopathy (n = 20) and 
      TDP-43 proteinopathy (n = 12). To identify a potential biological basis for disease 
      duration, neuroimaging measures of white matter integrity were evaluated (n = 37). 
      RESULTS: Carriers of risk allele (T) in rs1768208 (i.e., MOBP RA+) had a shorter 
      median disease duration (TC/TT = 5.5 years, CC = 9.5 years; p = 0.02). This was also 
      found in the subset of cases with autopsy-confirmed tauopathies (p = 0.04) but not 
      with TDP-43 proteinopathies (p > 0.1). By comparison, polymorphisms at rs8070723 
      (MAPT) had no effect on disease duration (p > 0.1), although carriers of protective 
      allele (G) in rs8070723 had a younger median age at onset (AG/GG = 54.5 years, AA = 
      58 years; p < 0.01). MOBP RA+ patients had increased radial diffusivity in the 
      superior corona radiata and midbrain, and reduced fractional anisotropy in the 
      superior corona radiata as well as superior and inferior longitudinal fasciculi 
      compared with noncarriers (p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The rs1768208 risk polymorphism 
      in MOBP may have prognostic value in bvFTD. MOBP RA+ patients have more severe white 
      matter degeneration in bvFTD that may contribute to shorter disease duration. Future 
      studies are needed to help confirm these findings.

AB  - Recent evidence have suggested that neuroinflammation and ischemia induce the 
      activation of two different types of reactive astrocytes, termed A1 and A2. 
      Additionally, A1 astrocytes contribute to the death of neurons and oligodendrocytes 
      in neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). In the current 
      study, we constructed an Aβ42-activated microglia-conditioned medium to induce A1 
      astrocytic activation via secretion of interleukin 1α, tumor necrosis factor, and 
      complement component 1q in vitro, and indicated the regulatory role of milk fat 
      globule epidermal growth factor 8 (MFG-E8) on A1/A2 astrocytic alteration through 
      the downregulation of nuclear factor-κB and the upregulation of PI3K-Akt. This study 
      showed that MFG-E8 suppressed A1 astrocytes and holds great potential for the 
      treatment of AD.

AB  - One in three people will develop Alzheimer's disease (AD) or another dementia and, 
      despite intense research efforts, treatment options remain inadequate. Understanding 
      the mechanisms of AD pathogenesis remains our principal hurdle to developing 
      effective therapeutics to tackle this looming medical crisis. In light of recent 
      discoveries from whole-genome sequencing and technical advances in humanized models, 
      studying disease risk genes with induced human neural cells presents unprecedented 
      advantages. Here, we first review the current knowledge of the proposed mechanisms 
      underlying AD and focus on modern genetic insights to inform future studies. To 
      highlight the utility of human pluripotent stem cell-based innovations, we then 
      present an update on efforts in recapitulating the pathophysiology by induced 
      neuronal, non-neuronal and a collection of brain cell types, departing from the 
      neuron-centric convention. Lastly, we examine the translational potentials of such 
      approaches, and provide our perspectives on the promise they offer to deepen our 
      understanding of AD pathogenesis and to accelerate the development of intervention 
      strategies for patients and risk carriers.

TI  - Evidence of demyelination in mild cognitive impairment and dementia using a direct 
      and specific magnetic resonance imaging measure of myelin content.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: We investigated brain demyelination in aging, mild cognitive 
      impairment (MCI), and dementia using a direct magnetic resonance imaging marker of 
      myelin. METHODS: Brains of young and old controls, and old subjects with MCI, 
      Alzheimer's disease, or vascular dementia were scanned using our recently developed 
      myelin water fraction (MWF) mapping technique, which provides greatly improved 
      accuracy over previous comparable methods. Maps of MWF, a direct and specific myelin 
      measure, and relaxation times and magnetization transfer ratio, indirect and 
      nonspecific measures, were constructed. RESULTS: MCI subjects showed decreased MWF 
      compared with old controls. Demyelination was greater in Alzheimer's disease or 
      vascular dementia. As expected, decreased MWF was accompanied by decreased 
      magnetization transfer ratio and increased relaxation times. The young subjects 
      showed greater myelin content than the old subjects. DISCUSSION: We believe this to 
      be the first demonstration of myelin loss in MCI, Alzheimer's disease, and vascular 
      dementia using a method that provides a quantitative magnetic resonance 
      imaging-based measure of myelin. Our findings add to the emerging evidence that 
      myelination may represent an important biomarker for the pathology of MCI and 
      dementia. This study supports the investigation of the role of myelination in MCI 
      and dementia through use of this quantitative magnetic resonance imaging approach in 
      clinical studies of disease progression, and relationship of functional status to 
      myelination status. Furthermore, mapping MWF may permit myelin to serve as a 
      therapeutic target in clinical trials.

TI  - A single-nuclei RNA sequencing study of Mendelian and sporadic AD in the human 
      brain.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia. This 
      neurodegenerative disorder is associated with neuronal death and gliosis heavily 
      impacting the cerebral cortex. AD has a substantial but heterogeneous genetic 
      component, presenting both Mendelian and complex genetic architectures. Using bulk 
      RNA-seq from the parietal lobes and deconvolution methods, we previously reported 
      that brains exhibiting different AD genetic architecture exhibit different cellular 
      proportions. Here, we sought to directly investigate AD brain changes in cell 
      proportion and gene expression using single-cell resolution. METHODS: We generated 
      unsorted single-nuclei RNA sequencing data from brain tissue. We leveraged the 
      tissue donated from a carrier of a Mendelian genetic mutation, PSEN1 p.A79V, and two 
      family members who suffer from sporadic AD, but do not carry any autosomal 
      mutations. We evaluated alternative alignment approaches to maximize the titer of 
      reads, genes, and cells with high quality. In addition, we employed distinct 
      clustering strategies to determine the best approach to identify cell clusters that 
      reveal neuronal and glial cell types and avoid artifacts such as sample and batch 
      effects. We propose an approach to cluster cells that reduces biases and enable 
      further analyses. RESULTS: We identified distinct types of neurons, both excitatory 
      and inhibitory, and glial cells, including astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and 
      microglia, among others. In particular, we identified a reduced proportion of 
      excitatory neurons in the Mendelian mutation carrier, but a similar distribution of 
      inhibitory neurons. Furthermore, we investigated whether single-nuclei RNA-seq from 
      the human brains recapitulate the expression profile of disease-associated microglia 
      (DAM) discovered in mouse models. We also determined that when analyzing human 
      single-nuclei data, it is critical to control for biases introduced by 
      donor-specific expression profiles. CONCLUSION: We propose a collection of best 
      practices to generate a highly detailed molecular cell atlas of highly informative 
      frozen tissue stored in brain banks. Importantly, we have developed a new web 
      application to make this unique single-nuclei molecular atlas publicly available.

      Role in Neurodegenerative Disorders.
PG  - 287-310
AB  - During development and through adulthood, differentiation of diverse cell types is 
      controlled by specific genetic and molecular programs for which transcription 
      factors are master regulators of gene expression. Here, we present an overview of 
      the role of nuclear receptors and their selective pharmacological modulators in 
      oligodendrocytes linage, their role in myelination and remyelination and their 
      potential use as a therapeutic strategy for demyelinating diseases. We discuss 
      several aspects of nuclear receptors including: (1) the biochemistry of nuclear 
      receptors superfamily; (2) their role on stem cells physiology, focusing in 
      differentiation and cell removal; (3) the role of nuclear receptor in the 
      oligodendrocytes cell linage, from oligodendrocyte progenitors cells to mature 
      myelinating cells; and (4) the therapeutics opportunities of nuclear receptors for 
      specific demyelinating diseases.

TI  - Inferring Relevant Cell Types for Complex Traits by Using Single-Cell Gene 
      Expression.

AB  - Previous studies have prioritized trait-relevant cell types by looking for an 
      enrichment of genome-wide association study (GWAS) signal within functional regions. 
      However, these studies are limited in cell resolution by the lack of functional 
      annotations from difficult-to-characterize or rare cell populations. Measurement of 
      single-cell gene expression has become a popular method for characterizing novel 
      cell types, and yet limited work has linked single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) to 
      phenotypes of interest. To address this deficiency, we present RolyPoly, a 
      regression-based polygenic model that can prioritize trait-relevant cell types and 
      genes from GWAS summary statistics and gene expression data. RolyPoly is designed to 
      use expression data from either bulk tissue or single-cell RNA-seq. In this study, 
      we demonstrated RolyPoly's accuracy through simulation and validated previously 
      known tissue-trait associations. We discovered a significant association between 
      microglia and late-onset Alzheimer disease and an association between schizophrenia 
      and oligodendrocytes and replicating fetal cortical cells. Additionally, RolyPoly 
      computes a trait-relevance score for each gene to reflect the importance of 
      expression specific to a cell type. We found that differentially expressed genes in 
      the prefrontal cortex of individuals with Alzheimer disease were significantly 
      enriched with genes ranked highly by RolyPoly gene scores. Overall, our method 
      represents a powerful framework for understanding the effect of common variants on 
      cell types contributing to complex traits.

AB  - Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative condition that currently has no 
      known cure. The principles of the expanding field of network medicine (NM) have 
      recently been applied to AD research. The main principle of NM proposes that 
      diseases are much more complicated than one mutation in one gene, and incorporate 
      different genes, connections between genes, and pathways that may include multiple 
      diseases to create full scale disease networks. AD research findings as a result of 
      the application of NM principles have suggested that functional network 
      connectivity, myelination, myeloid cells, and genes and pathways may play an 
      integral role in AD progression, and may be integral to the search for a cure. 
      Different aspects of the AD pathology could be potential targets for drug therapy to 
      slow down or stop the disease from advancing, but more research is needed to reach 
      definitive conclusions. Additionally, the holistic approaches of network 
      pharmacology in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) research may be viable options 
      for the AD treatment, and may lead to an effective cure for AD in the future.

AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by an expansion 
      in the trinucleotide CAG repeat in exon-1 in the huntingtin gene, located on 
      chromosome 4. When the number of trinucleotide CAG exceeds 40 repeats, disease 
      invariably is manifested, characterized by motor, cognitive, and psychiatric 
      symptoms. The huntingtin (Htt) protein and its mutant form (mutant huntingtin, mHtt) 
      are ubiquitously expressed but although multiple brain regions are affected, the 
      most vulnerable brain region is the striatum. Striatal medium-sized spiny neurons 
      (MSNs) preferentially degenerate, followed by the cortical pyramidal neurons located 
      in layers V and VI. Proposed HD pathogenic mechanisms include, but are not 
      restricted to, excitotoxicity, neurotrophic support deficits, collapse of the 
      protein degradation mechanisms, mitochondrial dysfunction, transcriptional 
      alterations, and disorders of myelin. Studies performed in cell type-specific and 
      regionally selective HD mouse models implicate both MSN cell-autonomous properties 
      and cell-cell interactions, particularly corticostriatal but also with non-neuronal 
      cell types. Here, we review the intrinsic properties of MSNs that contribute to 
      their selective vulnerability and in addition, we discuss how astrocytes, microglia, 
      and oligodendrocytes, together with aberrant corticostriatal connectivity, 
      contribute to HD pathophysiology. In addition, mHtt causes cell-autonomous 
      dysfunction in cell types other than MSNs. These findings have implications in terms 
      of therapeutic strategies aimed at preventing neuronal dysfunction and degeneration.

AB  - White matter stroke (WMS) is a debilitating disorder, which is characterized by the 
      formation of ischemic lesions along subcortical white matter tracts of the central 
      nervous system. Initial infarction during the early stages of the disease is often 
      asymptomatic and is thus considered a form of silent stroke. However, over time 
      lesions accumulate, resulting in severe cognitive and motor decline of which there 
      are no known therapies. Functional imaging and post mortem analysis of patients 
      demonstrates a loss of oligodendrocytes and the subsequent damage of myelin as a 
      primary hallmark of WMS lesions. Though the adult mammalian brain maintains the 
      capacity to regenerate adult oligodendrocytes, this process is blocked in the 
      infarcted white matter thereby preventing remyelination. Recent evidence suggests 
      that activation of neural circuits via motor training or direct stimulation drives 
      oligodendrogenesis and de novo myelin synthesis, opening a potential avenue for 
      therapy in WMS.

PG  - 7741-7753
LID - 10.1007/s12035-019-1638-7 [doi]
AB  - The innate immune system and inflammatory response in the brain have critical 
      impacts on the pathogenesis of many neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's 
      disease (AD). In the central nervous system (CNS), the innate immune response is 
      primarily mediated by microglia. However, non-glial cells such as neurons could also 
      partake in inflammatory response independently through inflammasome signalling. The 
      NLR family pyrin domain-containing 1 (NLRP1) inflammasome in the CNS is primarily 
      expressed by pyramidal neurons and oligodendrocytes. NLRP1 is activated in response 
      to amyloid-β (Aβ) aggregates, and its activation subsequently cleaves caspase-1 into 
      its active subunits. The activated caspase-1 proteolytically processes 
      interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and interleukin-18 (IL-18) into maturation whilst 
      co-ordinately triggers caspase-6 which is responsible for apoptosis and axonal 
      degeneration. In addition, caspase-1 activation induces pyroptosis, an inflammatory 
      form of programmed cell death. Studies in murine AD models indicate that the Nlrp1 
      inflammasome is indeed upregulated in AD and neuronal death is observed leading to 
      cognitive decline. However, the mechanism of NLRP1 inflammasome activation in AD is 
      particularly elusive, given its structural and functional complexities. In this 
      review, we examine the implications of the human NLRP1 inflammasome and its 
      signalling pathways in driving neuroinflammation in AD.

AB  - The goal of this study was to determine the chronic impact of stroke on the 
      manifestation of Alzheimer's disease (AD) related pathology and behavioral 
      impairments in mice. To accomplish this goal, we used two distinct models. First, we 
      experimentally induced ischemic stroke in aged wildtype (wt) C57BL/6 mice to 
      determine if stroke leads to the manifestation of AD-associated pathological 
      β-amyloid (Aβ) and tau in aged versus young adult wt mice. Second, we utilized a 
      transgenic (Tg) mouse model of AD (hAPP-SL) to determine if stroke leads to the 
      worsening of pre-existing AD pathology, as well as the development of pathology in 
      brain regions not typically expressed in AD Tg mice. In the wt mice, there was 
      delayed motor recovery and an accelerated development of cognitive deficits in aged 
      mice compared to young adult mice following stroke. This corresponded with increased 
      brain atrophy, increased cholinergic degeneration, and a focal increase of Aβ in 
      areas of axonal degeneration in the ipsilateral hemisphere of the aged animals. By 
      contrast, in the hAPP-SL mice, we found that ischemia induced aggravated behavioral 
      deficits in conjunction with a global increase in Aβ(,) tau, and cholinergic 
      pathology compared to hAPP-SL mice that underwent a sham stroke procedure. With 
      regard to a potential mechanism, in both models, we found that the stroke-induced Aβ 
      and tau deposits co-localized with increased levels of β-secretase 1 (BACE1), along 
      with its substrate, neuregulin 1 (NGR1) type III, both of which are proteins 
      integral for myelin repair. Based on these findings, we propose that the chronic 
      sequelae of stroke may be ratcheting-up a myelin repair pathway, and that the 
      consequent increase in BACE1 could be causing an inadvertent cleavage of its 
      alternative substrate, AβPP, resulting in greater Aβ seeding and pathogenesis.

AB  - Induced neural stem cells (iNSCs) reprogrammed from somatic cells have great 
      potentials in cell replacement therapies and in vitro modeling of neural diseases. 
      Direct conversion of fibroblasts into iNSCs has been shown to depend on a couple of 
      key neural progenitor transcription factors (TFs), raising the question of whether 
      such direct reprogramming can be achieved by non-neural progenitor TFs. Here we 
      report that the non-neural progenitor TF Ptf1a alone is sufficient to directly 
      reprogram mouse and human fibroblasts into self-renewable iNSCs capable of 
      differentiating into functional neurons, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes, and 
      improving cognitive dysfunction of Alzheimer's disease mouse models when 
      transplanted. The reprogramming activity of Ptf1a depends on its Notch-independent 
      interaction with Rbpj which leads to subsequent activation of expression of TF genes 
      and Notch signaling required for NSC specification, self-renewal, and homeostasis. 
      Together, our data identify a non-canonical and safer approach to establish iNSCs 
      for research and therapeutic purposes.

AB  - Multiple system atrophy (MSA) is a neurodegenerative disease with diverse clinical 
      manifestations, including parkinsonism, cerebellar syndrome, and autonomic failure. 
      Pathologically, MSA is characterized by glial cytoplasmic inclusions in 
      oligodendrocytes, which contain fibrillary forms of α-synuclein. MSA is categorized 
      as one of the α-synucleinopathy, and α-synuclein aggregation is thought to be the 
      culprit of the disease pathogenesis. Studies on MSA pathogenesis are scarce relative 
      to studies on the pathogenesis of other synucleinopathies, such as Parkinson's 
      disease and dementia with Lewy bodies. However, recent developments in cellular and 
      animal models of MSA, especially α-synuclein transgenic models, have driven 
      advancements in research on this disease. Here, we review the currently available 
      models of MSA, which include toxicant-induced animal models, 
      α-synuclein-overexpressing cellular models, and mouse models that express 
      α-synuclein specifically in oligodendrocytes through cell type-specific promoters. 
      We will also discuss the results of studies in recently developed transmission mouse 
      models, into which MSA brain extracts were intracerebrally injected. By reviewing 
      the findings obtained from these model systems, we will discuss what we have learned 
      about the disease and describe the strengths and limitations of the models, thereby 
      ultimately providing direction for the design of better models and future research.

      alpha-synuclein pathology in experimental multiple system atrophy models.
PG  - 415-441

AB  - Multiple system atrophy (MSA) is characterized by the presence of distinctive glial 
      cytoplasmic inclusions (GCIs) within oligodendrocytes that contain the neuronal 
      protein alpha-synuclein (aSyn) and the oligodendroglia-specific phosphoprotein 
      TPPP/p25α. However, the role of oligodendroglial aSyn and p25α in the formation of 
      aSyn-rich GCIs remains unclear. To address this conundrum, we have applied human 
      aSyn (haSyn) pre-formed fibrils (PFFs) to rat wild-type (WT)-, haSyn-, or 
      p25α-overexpressing oligodendroglial cells and to primary differentiated 
      oligodendrocytes derived from WT, knockout (KO)-aSyn, and PLP-haSyn-transgenic mice. 
      HaSyn PFFs are readily taken up by oligodendroglial cells and can recruit minute 
      amounts of endogenous aSyn into the formation of insoluble, highly aggregated, 
      pathological assemblies. The overexpression of haSyn or p25α accelerates the 
      recruitment of endogenous protein and the generation of such aberrant species. In 
      haSyn PFF-treated primary oligodendrocytes, the microtubule and myelin networks are 
      disrupted, thus recapitulating a pathological hallmark of MSA, in a manner totally 
      dependent upon the seeding of endogenous aSyn. Furthermore, using oligodendroglial 
      and primary cortical cultures, we demonstrated that pathology-related S129 aSyn 
      phosphorylation depends on aSyn and p25α protein load and may involve different aSyn 
      "strains" present in oligodendroglial and neuronal synucleinopathies. Importantly, 
      this hypothesis was further supported by data obtained from human post-mortem brain 
      material derived from patients with MSA and dementia with Lewy bodies. Finally, 
      delivery of haSyn PFFs into the mouse brain led to the formation of aberrant aSyn 
      forms, including the endogenous protein, within oligodendroglia and evoked myelin 
      decompaction in WT mice, but not in KO-aSyn mice. This line of research highlights 
      the role of endogenous aSyn and p25α in the formation of pathological aSyn 
      assemblies in oligodendrocytes and provides in vivo evidence of the contribution of 
      oligodendroglial aSyn in the establishment of aSyn pathology in MSA.

AB  - To gain unfettered insight into one of the scourges of our aging societies, Mathys 
      and colleagues in Nature (Mathys et al., 2019) illuminate the brain transcriptome of 
      Alzheimer's disease at single-cell resolution. Their findings implicate 
      oligodendrocytes, a cell type largely neglected in Alzheimer's disease research, and 
      sex in the disease in intriguing ways.

TI  - Involvement of astrocyte and oligodendrocyte gene sets in migraine.
PG  - 640-7
LID - 10.1177/0333102415618614 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Migraine is a common episodic brain disorder characterized by recurrent 
      attacks of severe unilateral headache and additional neurological symptoms. Two main 
      migraine types can be distinguished based on the presence of aura symptoms that can 
      accompany the headache: migraine with aura and migraine without aura. Multiple 
      genetic and environmental factors confer disease susceptibility. Recent genome-wide 
      association studies (GWAS) indicate that migraine susceptibility genes are involved 
      in various pathways, including neurotransmission, which have already been implicated 
      in genetic studies of monogenic familial hemiplegic migraine, a subtype of migraine 
      with aura. METHODS: To further explore the genetic background of migraine, we 
      performed a gene set analysis of migraine GWAS data of 4954 clinic-based patients 
      with migraine, as well as 13,390 controls. Curated sets of synaptic genes and sets 
      of genes predominantly expressed in three glial cell types (astrocytes, microglia 
      and oligodendrocytes) were investigated. DISCUSSION: Our results show that gene sets 
      containing astrocyte- and oligodendrocyte-related genes are associated with 
      migraine, which is especially true for gene sets involved in protein modification 
      and signal transduction. Observed differences between migraine with aura and 
      migraine without aura indicate that both migraine types, at least in part, seem to 
      have a different genetic background.

AB  - Hemoglobins (Hbs) are heme-containing proteins binding oxygen, carbon monoxide, and 
      nitric oxide. While erythrocytes are the most well-known location of Hbs, Hbs also 
      exist in neurons, glia and oligodendroglia and they are primarily localized in the 
      inner mitochondrial membrane of neurons with likely roles in cellular respiration 
      and buffering protons. Recently, studies have suggested links between hypoxia and 
      neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer Disease (AD) and furthermore suggested 
      involvement of Hbs in the pathogenesis of AD. While cellular immunohistochemical 
      studies on AD brains have observed reduced levels of Hb in the cytoplasm of 
      pre-tangle and tangle-bearing neurons, other studies on homogenates of AD brain 
      samples observed increased Hb levels. This potential discrepancy may result from 
      differential presence and function of intracellular versus extracellular Hbs. 
      Intracellular Hbs may protect neurons against hypoxia and hyperoxia. On the other 
      hand, extracellular free Hb and its degradation products may trigger inflammatory 
      immune and oxidative reactions against neural macromolecules and/or damage the 
      blood-brain barrier. Therefore, biological processes leading to reduction of Hb 
      transcription (including clinically silent Hb mutations) may influence 
      intra-erythrocytic and neural Hbs, and reduce the transport of oxygen, carbon 
      monoxide and nitric oxide which may be involved in the (patho)physiology of 
      neurodegenerative disorders such as AD. Agents such as erythropoietin, which 
      stimulate both erythropoiesis, reduce eryptosis and induce intracellular neural Hbs 
      may exert multiple beneficial effects on the onset and course of AD. Thus, evidence 
      accumulates for a role of Hbs in the central nervous system while Hbs deserve more 
      attention as possible candidate molecules involved in AD.

AB  - To better understand the pathogenesis of dementia, it is important to understand 
      histopathologic changes in neurodegenerative diseases because they might highlight 
      key aspects of the degenerative process. In this study, the nuclear diameter of 
      neurons and oligodendrocytes in selected temporal lobe areas were determined in 
      autopsy tissue sections from patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), Lewy body 
      dementia (LBD) and controls. Our morphometric studies targeted neurons in the CA4 
      region of the pyramidal cell layer of the hippocampus, neurons in the granular layer 
      of the dentate gyrus and oligodendrocytes in parahippocampal white matter. Mean 
      neuronal nuclear diameters were not different among the studied groups. However, our 
      studies revealed a statistically significant reduction of mean oligodendrocyte 
      nuclear diameter in AD and LBD relative to controls. The reduction of the mean 
      nucleus diameter of oligodendrocytes in LBD was independent of the presence of 
      associated AD pathology in LBD. These findings for the first time identify decreased 
      oligodendrocyte nucleus diameter as a morphologic feature of AD and LBD and may lead 
      to a better understanding of the role of oligodendrocytes in AD and LBD 
      pathogenesis.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease with high 
      outbreak rates. It is estimated that about 35 million individuals around the world 
      suffered from dementia in 2010. AD is expected to increase twofold every 20 years 
      and, by 2030, approximately 65 million people could suffer from this illness. AD is 
      determined clinically by a cognitive impairment and pathologically by the production 
      of amyloid beta (Aβ), neurofibrillary tangles, toxic free radicals and inflammatory 
      mediators in the brain. There is still no treatment to cure or even alter the 
      progressive course of this disease; however, many new therapies are being 
      investigated and are at various stages of clinical trials. Neuropeptides are 
      signaling molecules used by neurons to communicate with each other. One of the 
      important neuropeptides is apelin, which can be isolated from bovine stomach. Apelin 
      and its receptor APJ have been shown to broadly disseminate in the neurons and 
      oligodendrocytes of the central nervous system. Apelin-13 is known to be the 
      predominant neuropeptide in neuroprotection. It is involved in the processes of 
      memory and learning as well as the prevention of neuronal damage. Studies have shown 
      that apelin can directly or indirectly prevent the production of Aβ and reduce its 
      amounts by increasing its degradation. Phosphorylation and accumulation of tau 
      protein may also be inhibited by apelin. Apelin is considered as an 
      anti-inflammatory agent by preventing the production of inflammatory mediators such 
      as interleukin-1β and tumor necrosis factor alpha. It has been shown that in vivo 
      and in vitro anti-apoptotic effects of apelin have prevented the death of neurons. 
      In this review, we describe the various functions of apelin associated with AD and 
      present an integrated overview of recent findings that, in general, recommend apelin 
      as a promising therapeutic agent in the treatment of this ailment.

AB  - Loss-of-function (LOF) variants of TREM2, an immune receptor expressed in microglia, 
      increase Alzheimer's disease risk. TREM2 senses lipids and mediates myelin 
      phagocytosis, but its role in microglial lipid metabolism is unknown. Combining 
      chronic demyelination paradigms and cell sorting with RNA sequencing and lipidomics, 
      we find that wild-type microglia acquire a disease-associated transcriptional state, 
      while TREM2-deficient microglia remain largely homeostatic, leading to neuronal 
      damage. TREM2-deficient microglia phagocytose myelin debris but fail to clear myelin 
      cholesterol, resulting in cholesteryl ester (CE) accumulation. CE increase is also 
      observed in APOE-deficient glial cells, reflecting impaired brain cholesterol 
      transport. This finding replicates in myelin-treated TREM2-deficient murine 
      macrophages and human iPSC-derived microglia, where it is rescued by an ACAT1 
      inhibitor and LXR agonist. Our studies identify TREM2 as a key transcriptional 
      regulator of cholesterol transport and metabolism under conditions of chronic myelin 
      phagocytic activity, as TREM2 LOF causes pathogenic lipid accumulation in microglia.

TI  - Pathogenesis of white matter changes in cerebral small vessel diseases: beyond 
      vessel-intrinsic mechanisms.
PG  - 635-651
LID - 10.1042/CS20160380 [doi]
AB  - Cerebral small vessel diseases (SVDs) are a leading cause of age and 
      hypertension-related stroke and dementia. The salient features of SVDs visible on 
      conventional brain magnetic resonance images include white matter hyperintensities 
      (WMHs) on T2-weighted images, small infarcts, macrohemorrhages, dilated perivascular 
      spaces, microbleeds and brain atrophy. Among these, WMHs are the most common and 
      often the earliest brain tissue changes. Moreover, over the past two decades, large 
      population- and patient-based studies have established the clinical importance of 
      WMHs, notably with respect to cognitive and motor disturbances. Here, we seek to 
      provide a new and critical look at the pathogenesis of SVD-associated white matter 
      (WM) changes. We first review our current knowledge of WM biology in the healthy 
      brain, and then consider the main clinical and pathological features of WM changes 
      in SVDs. The most widely held view is that SVD-associated WM lesions are caused by 
      chronic hypoperfusion, impaired cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR) or blood-brain 
      barrier (BBB) leakage. Here, we assess the arguments for and against each of these 
      mechanisms based on population, patient and experimental model studies, and further 
      discuss other potential mechanisms. Specifically, building on two recent seminal 
      studies that have uncovered an anatomical and functional relationship between 
      oligodendrocyte progenitor cells and blood vessels, we elaborate on how small vessel 
      changes might compromise myelin remodelling and cause WM degeneration. Finally, we 
      propose new directions for future studies on this hot research topic.

TI  - Argyrophilic grain disease: a clinicopathological review of an overlooked tauopathy.
PG  - 277-283
LID - 34462 [pii]
LID - 10.5114/fn.2018.80859 [doi]
AB  - Argyrophilic grain disease (AGD) is a sporadic tauopathy and actually the second 
      most frequent cause of dementia after Alzheimer's disease. Patients can present with 
      slowly progressive cognitive decline as well as psychiatric manifestations such as 
      depression. Definite diagnosis of AGD can only be made by post-mortem examination of 
      the brain. Neuropathological features include argyrophilic grains in limbic areas 
      along with oligodendroglial coiled bodies in hippocampal and amygdaloid white 
      matter, and ballooned neurons in the amygdala. AGD, however, can often be overlooked 
      and missed on neuropathologic examination as there are actually no specific clinical 
      manifestations that would be considered highly suggestive of AGD. Thus, it is not 
      uncommon to find neuropathological features of AGD in patients who do not present 
      with any apparent neurological manifestations. The aim of this review is to provide 
      an overview of what is currently known about AGD as well as raise its awareness 
      among both neurologists and neuropathologists who may otherwise overlook this 
      interesting tauopathy. We believe that patients above the age of 60 years should 
      undergo post-mortem screening for AGD to avoid missed opportunity for diagnosis and 
      enable future clinicopathological studies.

AB  - Targeted expression of genes coding for proteins specific to astrocytes, 
      oligodendrocytes and myelin was performed in frontal cortex area 8 of 
      Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease methionine/methionine and valine/valine (CJD MM1 and VV2, 
      respectively) compared with controls. GFAP (glial fibrillary acidic protein) mRNA 
      was up-regulated whereas SLC1A2 (solute carrier family 1 member 2, coding for 
      glutamate transporter 1: GLT1), AQ4 (aquaporin 4), MPC1 (mitochondrial pyruvate 
      carrier 1) and UCP5 (mitochondrial uncoupled protein 5) mRNAs were significantly 
      down-regulated in CJD MM1 and CJD VV2, and GJA1 (connexin 43) in CJD VV2. OLIG1 and 
      OLIG2 (oligodendocyte transcription factor 1 and 2, respectively), SOX10 (SRY-Box10) 
      and oligodendroglial precursor cell (OPC) marker NG2 (neuronal/glial antigen) 2 were 
      preserved, but GALC (coding for galactosylceramidase), SLC2A1 (solute carrier family 
      2 member 1: glucose transporter member 1: GLUT1) and MCT1 (monocarboxylic acid 
      transporter 1) mRNA expression levels were significantly reduced in CJD MM1 and CJD 
      VV2. Expression levels of most genes linked to myelin were not altered in the 
      cerebral cortex in CJD. Immunohistochemistry to selected proteins disclosed 
      individual variations but GFAP, Olig-2, AQ4 and GLUT1 correlated with mRNA levels, 
      whereas GLT1 was subjected to individual variations. However, MPC1, UCP5 and MCT1 
      decrease was more closely related to the respective reduced neuronal immunostaining. 
      These observations support the idea that molecular deficits linked to energy 
      metabolism and solute transport in astrocytes and oligodendrocytes, in addition to 
      neurons, are relevant in the pathogenesis of cortical lesions in CJD.

TI  - Integrative network analysis of nineteen brain regions identifies molecular 
      signatures and networks underlying selective regional vulnerability to Alzheimer's 
      disease.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia, 
      characterized by progressive cognitive impairment and neurodegeneration. However, 
      despite extensive clinical and genomic studies, the molecular basis of AD 
      development and progression remains elusive. METHODS: To elucidate molecular systems 
      associated with AD, we developed a large scale gene expression dataset from 1053 
      postmortem brain samples across 19 cortical regions of 125 individuals with a 
      severity spectrum of dementia and neuropathology of AD. We excluded brain specimens 
      that evidenced neuropathology other than that characteristic of AD. For the first 
      time, we performed a pan-cortical brain region genomic analysis, characterizing the 
      gene expression changes associated with a measure of dementia severity and multiple 
      measures of the severity of neuropathological lesions associated with AD (neuritic 
      plaques and neurofibrillary tangles) and constructing region-specific co-expression 
      networks. We rank-ordered 44,692 gene probesets, 1558 co-expressed gene modules and 
      19 brain regions based upon their association with the disease traits. RESULTS: The 
      neurobiological pathways identified through these analyses included actin 
      cytoskeleton, axon guidance, and nervous system development. Using public human 
      brain single-cell RNA-sequencing data, we computed brain cell type-specific marker 
      genes for human and determined that many of the abnormally expressed gene signatures 
      and network modules were specific to oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, and neurons. 
      Analysis based on disease severity suggested that: many of the gene expression 
      changes, including those of oligodendrocytes, occurred early in the progression of 
      disease, making them potential translational/treatment development targets and 
      unlikely to be mere bystander result of degeneration; several modules were closely 
      linked to cognitive compromise with lesser association with traditional measures of 
      neuropathology. The brain regional analyses identified temporal lobe gyri as sites 
      associated with the greatest and earliest gene expression abnormalities. 
      CONCLUSIONS: This transcriptomic network analysis of 19 brain regions provides a 
      comprehensive assessment of the critical molecular pathways associated with AD 
      pathology and offers new insights into molecular mechanisms underlying selective 
      regional vulnerability to AD at different stages of the progression of cognitive 
      compromise and development of the canonical neuropathological lesions of AD.

AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is characterized by hypomyelination and neuronal loss. To 
      assess the basis for myelin loss in HD, we generated bipotential glial progenitor 
      cells (GPCs) from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) derived from mutant Huntingtin 
      (mHTT) embryos or normal controls and performed RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) to assess 
      mHTT-dependent changes in gene expression. In human GPCs (hGPCs) derived from 3 mHTT 
      hESC lines, transcription factors associated with glial differentiation and myelin 
      synthesis were sharply downregulated relative to normal hESC GPCs; NKX2.2, OLIG2, 
      SOX10, MYRF, and their downstream targets were all suppressed. Accordingly, when 
      mHTT hGPCs were transplanted into hypomyelinated shiverer mice, the resultant glial 
      chimeras were hypomyelinated; this defect could be rescued by forced expression of 
      SOX10 and MYRF by mHTT hGPCs. The mHTT hGPCs also manifested impaired astrocytic 
      differentiation and developed abnormal fiber architecture. White matter involution 
      in HD is thus a product of the cell-autonomous, mHTT-dependent suppression of glial 
      differentiation.

TI  - Decreased Regenerative Capacity of Oligodendrocyte Progenitor Cells (NG2-Glia) in 
      the Ageing Brain: A Vicious Cycle of Synaptic Dysfunction, Myelin Loss and Neuronal 
      Disruption?
PG  - 413-8
AB  - Oligodendrocytes are specialised glial cells that myelinate CNS axons. Myelinated 
      axons are bundled together into white matter tracts that interconnect grey matter 
      areas of the brain and are essential for rapid, integrated neuronal communication 
      and cognitive function. Life-long generation of oligodendrocytes is required for 
      myelination of new neuronal connections and repair of myelin lost through natural 
      'wear and tear'. This is the function of a substantial population of adult 
      oligodendrocyte progenitors (OPs). Notably, there is white matter shrinkage and 
      decreased myelination in the ageing brain, which is accelerated in dementia. The 
      underlying causes of myelin loss in dementia are unresolved, but it implies a 
      decline in the regenerative capacity of OPs. A feature of OPs is that they form 
      neuron-glial synapses and respond to glutamate released by neurons via a range of 
      glutamate receptors. Glutamate neurotransmission onto OPs is proposed to regulate 
      their proliferation and differentiation into myelinating oligodendrocytes. Here, we 
      discuss evidence that deregulation of glutamate neurotransmission in dementia and 
      compromised generation of oligodendrocytes from OPs are key features of myelin loss 
      and associated cognitive decline.

AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) are among the human 
      synucleinopathies, which show alpha-synuclein immunoreactive neuronal and/or glial 
      aggregations and progressive neuronal loss in selected brain regions (eg, substantia 
      nigra, ventral tegmental area, pedunculopontine nucleus). Despite several studies 
      about brainstem pathologies in PD and DLB, there is currently no detailed 
      information available regarding the presence of alpha-synuclein immunoreactive 
      inclusions (i) in the cranial nerve, precerebellar, vestibular and oculomotor 
      brainstem nuclei and (ii) in brainstem fiber tracts and oligodendroctyes. Therefore, 
      we analyzed the inclusion pathologies in the brainstem nuclei (Lewy bodies, LB; Lewy 
      neurites, LN; coiled bodies, CB) and fiber tracts (LN, CB) of PD and DLB patients. 
      As reported in previous studies, LB and LN were most prevalent in the substantia 
      nigra, ventral tegmental area, pedunculopontine and raphe nuclei, periaqueductal 
      gray, locus coeruleus, parabrachial nuclei, reticular formation, prepositus 
      hypoglossal, dorsal motor vagal and solitary nuclei. Additionally we were able to 
      demonstrate LB and LN in all cranial nerve nuclei, premotor oculomotor, 
      precerebellar and vestibular brainstem nuclei, as well as LN in all brainstem fiber 
      tracts. CB were present in nearly all brainstem nuclei and brainstem fiber tracts 
      containing LB and/or LN. These findings can contribute to a large variety of less 
      well-explained PD and DLB symptoms (eg, gait and postural instability, impaired 
      balance and postural reflexes, falls, ingestive and oculomotor dysfunctions) and 
      point to the occurrence of disturbances of intra-axonal transport processes and 
      transneuronal spread of the underlying pathological processes of PD and DLB along 
      anatomical pathways.

AB  - Although much prior work has focused on the basal ganglia and cortical pathology 
      that defines Huntington's disease (HD), recent studies have also begun to 
      characterize cerebral white matter damage (Rosas et al., 2006; Dumas et al., 2012; 
      Poudel et al., 2014). In this study, we investigated differences in the large 
      fascicular bundles of the cerebral white matter of gene-positive HD carriers, 
      including pre-manifest individuals and early symptomatic patients, using recently 
      developed diffusion tractography procedures. We examined eighteen major fiber 
      bundles in 37 patients with early HD (average age 55.2 ± 11.5, 14 male, 23 female), 
      31 gene-positive, motor negative pre-symptomatic HD (PHD) (average age 48.1 ± 11.5, 
      13 male, 18 female), and 38 healthy age-matched controls (average age 55.7 ± 8.6, 14 
      male, 24 female), using the TRActs Constrained by UnderLying Anatomy (TRACULA) 
      procedure available as part of the FreeSurfer image processing software package. We 
      calculated the mean fractional anisotropy (FA) and the mean radial (RD) and axial 
      diffusivities (AD) for each fiber bundle. We also evaluated the relationships 
      between diffusion measures, cognition and regional cortical thinning. We found that 
      early changes in RD of select tracts in PHD subjects were associated with impaired 
      performance on neuropsychological tests, suggesting that early changes in myelin 
      might underlie early cognitive dysfunction. Finally, we found that increases in AD 
      of select tracts were associated with regionally select cortical thinning of areas 
      known to atrophy in HD, including the sensorimotor, supramarginal and fusiform 
      gyrus, suggesting that AD may be reflecting pyramidal cell degeneration in HD. 
      Together, these results suggest that white matter microstructural changes in HD 
      reflect a complex, clinically relevant and dynamic process.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Oligodendrocytes (OLs) and myelin are critical for normal brain function 
      and have been implicated in neurodegeneration. Several lines of evidence including 
      neuroimaging and neuropathological data suggest that Alzheimer's disease (AD) may be 
      associated with dysmyelination and a breakdown of OL-axon communication. METHODS: In 
      order to understand this phenomenon on a molecular level, we systematically 
      interrogated OL-enriched gene networks constructed from large-scale genomic, 
      transcriptomic and proteomic data obtained from human AD postmortem brain samples. 
      We then validated these networks using gene expression datasets generated from mice 
      with ablation of major gene expression nodes identified in our AD-dysregulated 
      networks. RESULTS: The robust OL gene coexpression networks that we identified were 
      highly enriched for genes associated with AD risk variants, such as BIN1 and 
      demonstrated strong dysregulation in AD. We further corroborated the structure of 
      the corresponding gene causal networks using datasets generated from the brain of 
      mice with ablation of key network drivers, such as UGT8, CNP and PLP1, which were 
      identified from human AD brain data. Further, we found that mice with genetic 
      ablations of Cnp mimicked aspects of myelin and mitochondrial gene expression 
      dysregulation seen in brain samples from patients with AD, including decreased 
      protein expression of BIN1 and GOT2. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides a molecular 
      blueprint of the dysregulation of gene expression networks of OL in AD and 
      identifies key OL- and myelination-related genes and networks that are highly 
      associated with AD.

TI  - LINGO-1 antibody ameliorates myelin impairment and spatial memory deficits in the 
      early stage of 5XFAD mice.

AB  - AIMS: Multiple evidence has indicated that myelin injury is common in Alzheimer's 
      disease (AD). However, whether myelin injury is an early event in AD and the 
      relationship between it and cognitive function is still elusive. METHODS: Spatial 
      memory of 5XFAD mice was determined by Morris water maze at 1 and 3 months old. 
      Meanwhile, the deposition of Aβ, the expression of myelin basic protein (MBP), 
      LINGO-1, NgR, and myelin ultrastructure in many memory-associated brain regions were 
      detected in one-month-old and three-month-old mice (before and after LINGO-1 
      antibody administration) using immunostaining, Western blot (WB), and transmission 
      electron microscopy (TEM), respectively. RESULTS: No abnormal Aβ deposition was 
      found in one-month-old 5XFAD mice. However, spatial memory deficits were proved in 
      accordance with an obvious demyelination in memory-associated brain regions in 
      one-month-old mice and both deteriorated with age. Administration of LINGO-1 
      antibody could obviously restore the myelin impairments in CA1 and DG region and 
      partially ameliorate spatial memory deficits. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrated 
      that myelin injury was an early event in 5XFAD mice even prior to emergence of 
      deposition of Aβ. Intervention with the LINGO-1 antibody could attenuate impaired 
      spatial memory deficits by remyelination, which suggested that myelin injury was 
      involved in spatial memory deficits and remyelination may be a potential therapeutic 
      strategy in early stage of AD or mild cognitive impairments.

TI  - Association of Amyloid Pathology With Myelin Alteration in Preclinical Alzheimer 
      Disease.
PG  - 41-49

AB  - IMPORTANCE: The accumulation of aggregated β-amyloid and tau proteins into plaques 
      and tangles is a central feature of Alzheimer disease (AD). While plaque and tangle 
      accumulation likely contributes to neuron and synapse loss, disease-related changes 
      to oligodendrocytes and myelin are also suspected of playing a role in development 
      of AD dementia. Still, to our knowledge, little is known about AD-related myelin 
      changes, and even when present, they are often regarded as secondary to concomitant 
      arteriosclerosis or related to aging. OBJECTIVE: To assess associations between 
      hallmark AD pathology and novel quantitative neuroimaging markers while being 
      sensitive to white matter myelin content. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: 
      Magnetic resonance imaging was performed at an academic research neuroimaging center 
      on a cohort of 71 cognitively asymptomatic adults enriched for AD risk. Lumbar 
      punctures were performed and assayed for cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers of AD 
      pathology, including β-amyloid 42, total tau protein, phosphorylated tau 181, and 
      soluble amyloid precursor protein. We measured whole-brain longitudinal and 
      transverse relaxation rates as well as the myelin water fraction from each of these 
      individuals. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Automated brain mapping algorithms and 
      statistical models were used to evaluate the relationships between age, CSF 
      biomarkers of AD pathology, and quantitative magnetic resonance imaging relaxometry 
      measures, including the longitudinal and transverse relaxation rates and the myelin 
      water fraction. RESULTS: The mean (SD) age for the 19 male participants and 52 
      female participants in the study was 61.6 (6.4) years. Widespread age-related 
      changes to myelin were observed across the brain, particularly in late myelinating 
      brain regions such as frontal white matter and the genu of the corpus callosum. 
      Quantitative relaxometry measures were negatively associated with levels of CSF 
      biomarkers across brain white matter and in areas preferentially affected in AD. 
      Furthermore, significant age-by-biomarker interactions were observed between myelin 
      water fraction and phosphorylated tau 181/β-amyloid 42, suggesting that 
      phosphorylated tau 181/β-amyloid 42 levels modulate age-related changes in myelin 
      water fraction. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These findings suggest amyloid 
      pathologies significantly influence white matter and that these abnormalities may 
      signify an early feature of the disease process. We expect that clarifying the 
      nature of myelin damage in preclinical AD may be informative on the disease's course 
      and lead to new markers of efficacy for prevention and treatment trials.

AB  - Toll-like receptors mediate important cellular immune responses upon activation via 
      various pathogenic stimuli such as bacterial or viral components. The activation and 
      subsequent secretion of cytokines and proinflammatory factors occurs in the whole 
      body including the brain. The subsequent inflammatory response is crucial for the 
      immune system to clear the pathogen(s) from the body via the innate and adaptive 
      immune response. Within the brain, astrocytes, neurons, microglia, and 
      oligodendrocytes all bear unique compositions of Toll-like receptors. Besides 
      pathogens, cellular damage and abnormally folded protein aggregates, such as tau and 
      Amyloid beta peptides, have been shown to activate Toll-like receptors in 
      neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. This review provides an 
      overview of the different cell type-specific Toll-like receptors of the human brain, 
      their activation mode, and subsequent cellular response, as well as their activation 
      in Alzheimer's disease. Finally, we critically evaluate the therapeutic potential of 
      targeting Toll-like receptors for treatment of Alzheimer's disease as well as 
      discussing the limitation of mouse models in understanding Toll-like receptor 
      function in general and in Alzheimer's disease.

TI  - notch3 is essential for oligodendrocyte development and vascular integrity in

AB  - Mutations in the human NOTCH3 gene cause CADASIL syndrome (cerebral autosomal 
      dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy). CADASIL is 
      an inherited small vessel disease characterized by diverse clinical manifestations 
      including vasculopathy, neurodegeneration and dementia. Here we report two mutations 
      in the zebrafish notch3 gene, one identified in a previous screen for mutations with 
      reduced expression of myelin basic protein (mbp) and another caused by a retroviral 
      insertion. Reduced mbp expression in notch3 mutant embryos is associated with fewer 
      oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs). Despite an early neurogenic phenotype, mbp 
      expression recovered at later developmental stages and some notch3 homozygous 
      mutants survived to adulthood. These mutants, as well as adult zebrafish carrying 
      both mutant alleles together, displayed a striking stress-associated accumulation of 
      blood in the head and fins. Histological analysis of mutant vessels revealed 
      vasculopathy, including: an enlargement (dilation) of vessels in the telencephalon 
      and fin, disorganization of the normal stereotyped arrangement of vessels in the 
      fin, and an apparent loss of arterial morphological structure. Expression of hey1, a 
      well-known transcriptional target of Notch signaling, was greatly reduced in notch3 
      mutant fins, suggesting that Notch3 acts via a canonical Notch signaling pathway to 
      promote normal vessel structure. Ultrastructural analysis confirmed the presence of 
      dilated vessels in notch3 mutant fins and revealed that the vessel walls of presumed 
      arteries showed signs of deterioration. Gaps in the arterial wall and the presence 
      of blood cells outside of vessels in mutants indicated that compromised vessel 
      structure led to hemorrhage. In notch3 heterozygotes, we found elevated expression 
      of both notch3 itself and target genes, indicating that specific alterations in gene 
      expression due to partial loss of Notch3 function might contribute to the 
      abnormalities observed in heterozygous larvae and adults. Our analysis of zebrafish 
      notch3 mutants indicates that Notch3 regulates OPC development and mbp gene 
      expression in larvae, and maintains vascular integrity in adults.

TI  - Pericyte-derived bone morphogenetic protein 4 underlies white matter damage after 
      chronic hypoperfusion.
PG  - 521-535
LID - 10.1111/bpa.12523 [doi]
AB  - Subcortical small vessel disease (SVD) is characterized by white matter damage 
      resulting from arteriolosclerosis and chronic hypoperfusion. Transforming growth 
      factor beta 1 (TGFB1) is dysregulated in the hereditary SVD, CARASIL (cerebral 
      autosomal recessive arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy). 
      However, very little is known about the role of the largest group in the TGFB 
      superfamily - the bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) - in SVD pathogenesis. The aim 
      of this study was to characterize signaling abnormalities of BMPs in sporadic SVD. 
      We examined immunostaining of TGFB1 and BMPs (BMP2/BMP4/BMP6/BMP7/BMP9) in a total 
      of 19 post-mortem human brain samples as follows: 7 SVD patients (4 males, 76-90 
      years old); 6 Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients (2 males, 67-93 years old) and 6 
      age-matched disease controls (3 males, 68-78 years old). We subsequently 
      investigated the effects of oxygen-glucose deprivation and BMP4 addition on cultured 
      cells. Furthermore, adult mice were subjected to chronic cerebral hypoperfusion 
      using bilateral common carotid artery stenosis, followed by continuous 
      intracerebroventricular infusion of the BMP antagonist, noggin. In the SVD cases, 
      BMP4 was highly expressed in white matter pericytes. Oxygen-glucose deprivation 
      induced BMP4 expression in cultured pericytes in vitro. Recombinant BMP4 increased 
      the number of cultured endothelial cells and pericytes and converted oligodendrocyte 
      precursor cells into astrocytes. Chronic cerebral hypoperfusion in vivo also 
      upregulated BMP4 with concomitant white matter astrogliogenesis and reduced 
      oligodendrocyte lineage cells, both of which were suppressed by 
      intracerebroventricular noggin infusion. Our findings suggest ischemic white matter 
      damage evolves in parallel with BMP4 upregulation in pericytes. BMP4 promotes 
      angiogenesis, but induces astrogliogenesis at the expense of oligodendrocyte 
      precursor cell proliferation and maturation, thereby aggravating white matter 
      damage. This may explain white matter vulnerability to chronic hypoperfusion. The 
      regulation of BMP4 signaling is a potential therapeutic strategy for treating SVD.

TI  - Immunoreactivity of myelin-associated oligodendrocytic basic protein in Lewy bodies.
PG  - 279-285
LID - 10.1111/neup.12564 [doi]
AB  - Myelin-associated oligodendrocytic basic protein (MOBP) plays a role in structural 
      maintenance of the myelin sheath in the central nervous system. Recent genome 
      analyses have revealed that mutation in MOBP is a risk factor for various 
      neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), tauopathies and 
      transactivation response DNA-binding protein 43 kDa proteinopathies. Proteomics 
      analysis has shown that MOBP is a component of cortical Lewy bodies (LBs). However, 
      the immunohistochemical localization of MOBP in the human brain is not known. Using 
      immunohistochemistry, we examined the brain, spinal cord and peripheral ganglia from 
      patients with various neurodegenerative diseases and control subjects. In normal 
      controls, MOBP immunoreactivity was evident in the myelin in the central and 
      peripheral nervous systems (PNS), and neuronal cytoplasm in both the central and 
      PNS. In Parkinson's disease and dementia with LBs, MOBP immunoreactivity was found 
      in the core of LBs in the brainstem, cingulate cortex and sympathetic ganglia. No 
      MOBP immunoreactivity was found in a variety of other neuronal or glial inclusions 
      in other disorders, including multiple system atrophy, AD, Pick's disease, 
      progressive supranuclear palsy, corticobasal degeneration, argyrophilic grain 
      disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal lobar degeneration. 
      Considering that up-regulation of MOBP has been reported in neurotoxic conditions, 
      accumulation of MOBP in LBs may imply a cytoprotective mechanism in LB disease.

TI  - Hypothesis on the pathogenesis of vacuolar myelopathy, dementia, and peripheral 
      neuropathy in AIDS.
PG  - 23-8
AB  - Certain aspects of the clinical syndrome of dementia, cerebral atrophy, 
      predominantly sensory neuropathy, and vacuolar myelopathy in AIDS resemble those 
      seen in vitamin B12 deficiency. Pathologically, there are similarities not only in 
      the changes in the spinal cord, but also in the brain and peripheral nerves. The 
      pathogenesis of vacuolar myelopathy may be secondary to a combination of immune 
      mediated myelin and oligodendrocyte injury, and simultaneous impairment of repair 
      mechanisms due to a deficiency of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM). Products derived from 
      macrophages may interfere directly with the methyl transfer cycle through the 
      generation of reactive oxygen intermediates and reactions involving nitric oxide and 
      peroxynitrite which may limit the supply of methionine for conversion to SAM, both 
      by direct interaction as well as through inhibition of methionine synthase. 
      Macrophage activation with secretion of cytokines and other biologically reactive 
      substances within the nervous system is sustained in the late stages of HIV 
      infection by the general effects of immune depletion, including loss of T cells 
      (with concomitant reduction of macrophage regulatory molecules) and recurrent 
      opportunistic infections, and may be further augmented by the local presence of the 
      virus itself (or its surface glycoprotein gp120). This would account for the common, 
      but not exclusive, occurrence of vacuolar myelopathy in AIDS. The ability of the 
      virus and its products to stimulate macrophage and microglial activation may also 
      explain the association between severity of vacuolar myelopathy and the presence of 
      HIV encephalitis. A similar mechanism may underlie the pathogenesis of dementia, 
      cerebral atrophy, and peripheral neuropathy. Local factors or differential 
      susceptibility between the central and peripheral nervous system may determine 
      whether myelinotoxic or neurotoxic processes predominate; the prominence of myelin 
      involvement in the spinal cord, and axonal involvement peripherally may reflect both 
      ends of this range, with the brain manifesting a more equal balance of both 
      processes.

TI  - The metalloprotease ADAMTS4 generates N-truncated Aβ4-x species and marks 
      oligodendrocytes as a source of amyloidogenic peptides in Alzheimer's disease.
PG  - 239-257
LID - 10.1007/s00401-018-1929-5 [doi]
AB  - Brain accumulation and aggregation of amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides is a critical step in 
      the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Full-length Aβ peptides (mainly Aβ1-40 
      and Aβ1-42) are produced through sequential proteolytic cleavage of the amyloid 
      precursor protein (APP) by β- and γ-secretases. However, studies of autopsy brain 
      samples from AD patients have demonstrated that a large fraction of insoluble Aβ 
      peptides are truncated at the N-terminus, with Aβ4-x peptides being particularly 
      abundant. Aβ4-x peptides are highly aggregation prone, but their origin and any 
      proteases involved in their generation are unknown. We have identified a recognition 
      site for the secreted metalloprotease ADAMTS4 (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase 
      with thrombospondin motifs 4) in the Aβ peptide sequence, which facilitates Aβ4-x 
      peptide generation. Inducible overexpression of ADAMTS4 in HEK293 cells resulted in 
      the secretion of Aβ4-40 but unchanged levels of Aβ1-x peptides. In the 5xFAD mouse 
      model of amyloidosis, Aβ4-x peptides were present not only in amyloid plaque cores 
      and vessel walls, but also in white matter structures co-localized with axonal APP. 
      In the ADAMTS4(-/-) knockout background, Aβ4-40 levels were reduced confirming a 
      pivotal role of ADAMTS4 in vivo. Surprisingly, in the adult murine brain, ADAMTS4 
      was exclusively expressed in oligodendrocytes. Cultured oligodendrocytes secreted a 
      variety of Aβ species, but Aβ4-40 peptides were absent in cultures derived from 
      ADAMTS4(-/-) mice indicating that the enzyme was essential for Aβ4-x production in 
      this cell type. These findings establish an enzymatic mechanism for the generation 
      of Aβ4-x peptides. They further identify oligodendrocytes as a source of these 
      highly amyloidogenic Aβ peptides.

AB  - Myelin is a membrane wrapped around the axon of the nerve cell, which is composed of 
      the mature oligodendrocytes. The role of myelin is to insulate and prevent the nerve 
      electrical impulses from the axon of the neurons to the axons of the other neurons, 
      which is essential for the proper functioning of the nervous system. Minor changes 
      in myelin thickness could lead to substantial changes in conduction speed and may 
      thus alter neural circuit function. Demyelination is the myelin damage, which 
      characterized by the loss of nerve sheath and the relative fatigue of the neuronal 
      sheath and axon. Studies have shown that myelin injury may be closely related to 
      neurodegenerative diseases and may be an early diagnostic criteria and therapeutic 
      target. Thus this review summarizes the recent result of pathologic effect and 
      signal pathways of myelin injury in neurodegenerative diseases, especially the 
      Alzheimer's disease to provide new and effective therapeutic targets.

TI  - Abundance of Synaptic Vesicle-Related Proteins in Alpha-Synuclein-Containing Protein 
      Inclusions Suggests a Targeted Formation Mechanism.
PG  - 883-897
LID - 10.1007/s12640-019-00014-0 [doi]
AB  - Proteinaceous α-synuclein-containing inclusions are found in affected brain regions 
      in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and 
      multiple system atrophy (MSA). These appear in neurons as Lewy bodies in both PD and 
      DLB and as glial cytoplasmic inclusions (GCIs) in oligodendrocytes in MSA. The role 
      they play in the pathology of the diseases is unknown, and relatively little is 
      still known about their composition. By purifying the inclusions from the 
      surrounding tissue and comprehensively analysing their protein composition, vital 
      clues to the formation mechanism and role in the disease process may be found. In 
      this study, Lewy bodies were purified from postmortem brain tissue from DLB cases 
      (n = 2) and GCIs were purified from MSA cases (n = 5) using a recently improved 
      purification method, and the purified inclusions were analysed by mass spectrometry. 
      Twenty-one percent of the proteins found consistently in the GCIs and LBs were 
      synaptic-vesicle related. Identified proteins included those associated with 
      exosomes (CD9), clathrin-mediated endocytosis (clathrin, AP-2 complex, dynamin), 
      retrograde transport (dynein, dynactin, spectrin) and synaptic vesicle fusion 
      (synaptosomal-associated protein 25, vesicle-associated membrane protein 2, 
      syntaxin-1). This suggests that the misfolded or excess α-synuclein may be targeted 
      to inclusions via vesicle-mediated transport, which also explains the presence of 
      the neuronal protein α-synuclein within GCIs.

AB  - Approximately a third of adults and half of children with acquired immunodeficiency 
      syndrome (AIDS) eventually suffer from neurological manifestations, including 
      dysfunction of cognition, movement, and sensation. Among the various pathologies 
      reported in the brain of patients with AIDS is neuronal injury and loss. A paradox 
      arises, however, because neurons themselves are for all intents and purposes not 
      infected by human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). This paper reviews evidence 
      suggesting that at least part of the neuronal injury observed in the brain of AIDS 
      patients is related to excessive influx of Ca2+. There is growing support for the 
      existence of HIV- or immune-related toxins that lead indirectly to the injury or 
      death of neurons via a potentially complex web of interactions between macrophages 
      (or microglia), astrocytes, and neurons. Human immunodeficiency virus-infected 
      monocytoid cells (macrophages, microglia, or monocytes), especially after 
      interacting with astrocytes, secrete substances that potentially contribute to 
      neurotoxicity. Not all of these substances are yet known, but they may include 
      eicosanoids, that is, arachidonic acid and its metabolites, as well as 
      platelet-activating factor. Macrophages activated by HIV-1 envelope protein gp120 
      also appear to release arachidonic acid and its metabolites. These factors can lead 
      to increased glutamate release or decreased glutamate reuptake. In addition, gamma 
      interferon (IFN-gamma) stimulation of macrophages induce release of the 
      glutamate-like agonist quinolinate. Human immunodeficiency virus-infected or 
      gp120-stimulated macrophages also produce cytokines, including tumor necrosis 
      factor-alpha and interleukin-1 beta, which contribute to astrogliosis. A final 
      common pathway for neuronal susceptibility appears to be operative, similar to that 
      observed in stroke, trauma, epilepsy, neuropathic pain, and several 
      neurodegenerative diseases, possibly including Huntington's disease, Parkinson's 
      disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. This mechanism involves the activation 
      of voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-operated 
      channels, and therefore offers hope for future pharmacological intervention. This 
      review focuses on clinically tolerated calcium channel antagonists and NMDA 
      antagonists with the potential for trials in humans with AIDS dementia in the near 
      future.

TI  - Refining the Spectrum of Neuronal Intranuclear Inclusion Disease: A Case Report.
PG  - 665-670
LID - 10.1093/jnen/nlz043 [doi]
AB  - Neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease (NIID) is a rare heterogeneous progressive 
      neurodegenerative disease characterized by the presence of eosinophilic hyaline 
      intranuclear inclusions in neuronal and glial cells of the CNS, peripheral cells of 
      the autonomic nervous system, visceral organs and skin. The clinical presentation is 
      broadly heterogeneous and includes limb weakness, dementia, seizures, ataxia, and 
      parkinsonism. High-intensity signal in the corticomedullary junction on brain MRI is 
      a characteristic finding in NIID. We describe a 65-year-old patient presenting with 
      mild cognitive impairment, evolving in dementia with behavioral disturbances and 
      parkinsonism. Brain MRI showed mild global cortical atrophy, more pronounced in the 
      cingulate and temporal cortex and mild leukoaraiosis, but no high-intensity signal 
      in corticomedullary junction on diffusion weighted imaging. Neuropathological 
      examination showed p62- and optineurin-positive neuronal intranuclear inclusions in 
      the hippocampus and in some subcortical structures. Glial cells did not present any 
      intranuclear inclusions, and no spongiotic changes proximal to the U-fibers or 
      diffuse myelin pallor were disclosed in the white matter. We report on a case with 
      pathological features of NIID showing different neuroimaging and pathological 
      findings. We noted an absence of typical MRI abnormalities, lack of intranuclear 
      inclusions in glial cells, and prominent involvement of hippocampal neurons, 
      refining the clinico-pathological spectrum of the disease.

TI  - Transgenic minipig model of Huntington's disease exhibiting gradually progressing 
      neurodegeneration.
LID - 10.1242/dmm.041319 [doi]
LID - dmm041319
AB  - Recently developed therapeutic approaches for the treatment of Huntington's disease 
      (HD) require preclinical testing in large animal models. The minipig is a suitable 
      experimental animal because of its large gyrencephalic brain, body weight of 
      70-100 kg, long lifespan, and anatomical, physiological and metabolic resemblance to 
      humans. The Libechov transgenic minipig model for HD (TgHD) has proven useful for 
      proof of concept of developing new therapies. However, to evaluate the efficacy of 
      different therapies on disease progression, a broader phenotypic characterization of 
      the TgHD minipig is needed. In this study, we analyzed the brain tissues of TgHD 
      minipigs at the age of 48 and 60-70 months, and compared them to wild-type animals. 
      We were able to demonstrate not only an accumulation of different forms of mutant 
      huntingtin (mHTT) in TgHD brain, but also pathological changes associated with 
      cellular damage caused by mHTT. At 48 months, we detected pathological changes that 
      included the demyelination of brain white matter, loss of function of striatal 
      neurons in the putamen and activation of microglia. At 60-70 months, we found a 
      clear marker of neurodegeneration: significant cell loss detected in the caudate 
      nucleus, putamen and cortex. This was accompanied by clusters of structures 
      accumulating in the neurites of some neurons, a sign of their degeneration that is 
      also seen in Alzheimer's disease, and a significant activation of astrocytes. In 
      summary, our data demonstrate age-dependent neuropathology with later onset of 
      neurodegeneration in TgHD minipigs.

TI  - Predominant expression of Alzheimer's disease-associated BIN1 in mature 
      oligodendrocytes and localization to white matter tracts.
PG  - 59

LID - 59
AB  - BACKGROUND: Genome-wide association studies have identified BIN1 within the second 
      most significant susceptibility locus in late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD). BIN1 
      undergoes complex alternative splicing to generate multiple isoforms with diverse 
      functions in multiple cellular processes including endocytosis and membrane 
      remodeling. An increase in BIN1 expression in AD and an interaction between BIN1 and 
      Tau have been reported. However, disparate descriptions of BIN1 expression and 
      localization in the brain previously reported in the literature and the lack of 
      clarity on brain BIN1 isoforms present formidable challenges to our understanding of 
      how genetic variants in BIN1 increase the risk for AD. METHODS: In this study, we 
      analyzed BIN1 mRNA and protein levels in human brain samples from individuals with 
      or without AD. In addition, we characterized the BIN1 expression and isoform 
      diversity in human and rodent tissue by immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting 
      using a panel of BIN1 antibodies. RESULTS: Here, we report on BIN1 isoform diversity 
      in the human brain and document alterations in the levels of select BIN1 isoforms in 
      individuals with AD. In addition, we report striking BIN1 localization to white 
      matter tracts in rodent and the human brain, and document that the large majority of 
      BIN1 is expressed in mature oligodendrocytes whereas neuronal BIN1 represents a 
      minor fraction. This predominant non-neuronal BIN1 localization contrasts with the 
      strict neuronal expression and presynaptic localization of the BIN1 paralog, 
      Amphiphysin 1. We also observe upregulation of BIN1 at the onset of postnatal 
      myelination in the brain and during differentiation of cultured oligodendrocytes. 
      Finally, we document that the loss of BIN1 significantly correlates with the extent 
      of demyelination in multiple sclerosis lesions. CONCLUSION: Our study provides new 
      insights into the brain distribution and cellular expression of an important risk 
      factor associated with late-onset AD. We propose that efforts to define how genetic 
      variants in BIN1 elevate the risk for AD would behoove to consider BIN1 function in 
      the context of its main expression in mature oligodendrocytes and the potential for 
      a role of BIN1 in the membrane remodeling that accompanies the process of 
      myelination.

AB  - Glial cytoplasmic inclusions (GCIs), commonly observed as α-synuclein 
      (α-syn)-positive aggregates within oligodendrocytes, are the pathological hallmark 
      of multiple system atrophy. The origin of α-syn in GCIs is uncertain; there is 
      little evidence of endogenous α-syn expression in oligodendrocyte lineage cells, 
      oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs), and mature oligodendrocytes (OLGs). Here, 
      based on in vitro analysis using primary rat cell cultures, we elucidated that 
      preformed fibrils (PFFs) generated from recombinant human α-syn trigger 
      multimerization and an upsurge of endogenous α-syn in OPCs, which is attributable to 
      insufficient autophagic proteolysis. RNA-seq analysis of OPCs revealed that α-syn 
      PFFs interfered with the expression of proteins associated with neuromodulation and 
      myelination. Furthermore, we detected cytoplasmic α-syn inclusions in OLGs through 
      differentiation of OPCs pre-incubated with PFFs. Overall, our findings suggest the 
      possibility of endogenous α-syn accumulation in OPCs that contributes to GCI 
      formation and perturbation of neuronal/glial support in multiple system atrophy 
      brains.

TI  - Human tau pathology transmits glial tau aggregates in the absence of neuronal tau.
LID - 10.1084/jem.20190783 [doi]
LID - e20190783
AB  - Tauopathies are characterized by abnormal accumulation of tau protein in neurons and 
      glia. In Alzheimer's disease (AD), tau aggregates in neurons, while in corticobasal 
      degeneration (CBD) and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), tau also aggregates in 
      astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. We previously demonstrated that human CBD and PSP 
      tauopathy lysates (CBD-tau and PSP-tau) contain distinct tau strains that propagate 
      neuronal and glial tau aggregates in nontransgenic (nonTg) mouse brain. Yet the 
      mechanism of glial tau transmission is unknown. Here, we developed a novel mouse 
      model to knock down tau in neurons to test for glial tau transmission. While 
      oligodendroglial tau pathology propagated across the mouse brain in the absence of 
      neuronal tau pathology, astrocytic tau pathology did not. Oligodendroglial tau 
      aggregates propagated along white matter tracts independently of neuronal axons, and 
      resulted in oligodendrocyte cell loss. Thus, glial tau pathology has significant 
      functional consequences independent of neuronal tau pathology.

AB  - Previous studies have demonstrated myelin deficits in Alzheimer's disease (AD). 
      However, it is still unclear whether myelin deficits occur at early stage of AD. Our 
      study aimed to investigate myelin deficits in 5XFAD mice dynamically in different 
      cognition-associated brain regions at early stage of AD. Transmission electron 
      microscopy (TEM) was applied to detect myelin changes in late-myelinating regions 
      such as prelimbic area (PrL), retrosplenial granular cortex (Rsg), field CA1 of 
      hippocampus (CA1) and entorhinal cortex (ERC) respectively at different stages (1, 
      2, 3 and 5 months of age) in 5XFAD mouse model. In addition, we assessed spatial 
      learning and memory with Morris water maze (MWM) in 5XFAD mice. Myelin deficits in 
      5XFAD mice started from 1 month of age and this deterioration continued during 
      ageing, whereas the same myelin abnormality could only be observed in 5-month-old 
      wild-type mice. Additionally, the g-ratio (an index associated with myelin 
      thickness) was increased in 1-month-old 5XFAD mice in the regions including PrL, CA1 
      and ERC, compared to wild-type mice. As animals aged, the increased g-ratio in 5XFAD 
      appeared in more regions of the brain. Moreover, 5XFAD mice showed spatial memory 
      deficits from 1 month of age and spatial learning deficits from 2 months of age. In 
      conclusion, myelin deficits occurred at an early stage and progressed with ageing in 
      5XFAD mouse model. Notably, a sequential myelin change was detected in 
      cognition-associated brain regions. Combined with cognitive examinations, this study 
      suggests that myelin changes might contribute to cognitive dysfunction.

TI  - TDP43 pathology in the brain, spinal cord, and dorsal root ganglia of a patient with 
      FOSMN.
PG  - e951-e956
LID - 10.1212/WNL.0000000000007008 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe the histopathologic features of a case of facial-onset 
      sensory and motor neuronopathy (FOSMN). METHODS: We describe a postmortem 
      examination performed on a 54-year-old man with FOSMN associated with personality 
      change. RESULTS: Postmortem examination revealed TAR DNA-binding protein (TDP) 43 
      proteinopathy with widespread distribution. TDP43 pathology was seen in the neurons 
      and glial cells and was most pronounced in the subthalamic nucleus followed by the 
      spinal cord, including dorsal root ganglia, brainstem, and other deep cerebral 
      nuclei. In the medial temporal lobe, neocortex and subcortical hemispheric white 
      matter TDP43 pathologic inclusions were very rare. In contrast to TDP43 pathologies 
      associated with typical amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) or frontotemporal 
      dementia (FTD)-TDP, in this case, there were more frequent TDP43-positive 
      oligodendroglial, coiled body-like cytoplasmic inclusions than neuronal inclusions. 
      Neuronal cytoplasmic TDP43 inclusions with globular and skein-like morphology were 
      seen in both anterior horn cells and dorsal root ganglia. No β-amyloid, α-synuclein, 
      or significant hyperphosphorylated tau pathology was seen. CONCLUSION: This case 
      provides further evidence that FOSMN is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by 
      TDP43 pathology. Despite minimal cortical TDP43 pathology, the clinical features of 
      the behavioral variant of FTD in this patient suggest that FOSMN may fall within or 
      overlap with the FTD-ALS spectrum.

TI  - Diffuse vacuolization (spongiosis) and arteriolosclerosis in the frontal white 
      matter occurs in vascular dementia.
PG  - 325-32
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine quantitatively white-matter changes at different sites in 
      patients with definite vascular dementia and Alzheimer's disease. DESIGN: 
      Prospective clinical and neuropathological series. SETTING: University Hospital 
      clinics (Helsinki, Finland and London, Ontario). SUBJECTS: Twenty-two patients with 
      a clinical and neuropathological diagnosis of vascular dementia and 20 patients with 
      Alzheimer's disease. MEASURES: The frequencies of focal white-matter lesions, 
      arteriolosclerosis, and cerebral amyloid angiopathy were assessed. Validated ratings 
      and cell counts were done in the subcortical U-fiber, centrum semiovale, and 
      periventricular areas of the frontal white matter. Degrees of abnormality (none, 
      mild, moderate, severe) were rated for spongiosis (vacuolization of white matter), 
      état criblé (widening of perivascular spaces), myelin loss, oligodendrocyte density, 
      axonal loss, and overall. Densities of oligodendrocytes and astrocytes (cells per 
      square millimeter) were determined. RESULTS: Patients with vascular dementia showed 
      focal white-matter lesions and arteriolosclerosis more often than patients with 
      Alzheimer's disease. The patients with vascular dementia also had significantly 
      greater spongiosis (P<.001), état criblé (P=.004), myelin loss (P<.005) and overall 
      white-matter abnormality (P<.001). Arteriolosclerosis was found in association with 
      spongiosis but not with état criblé. Cerebral amyloid angiopathy did not appear to 
      be related to any of the white-matter changes in patients with either vascular 
      dementia or Alzheimer's disease. The U-fiber area showed fewer changes, and the 
      periventricular area tended to be most affected. CONCLUSION: In addition to focal 
      infarcts, patients with vascular dementia showed widespread diffuse changes, 
      including spongiosis and arteriolosclerosis, along with état criblé and myelin loss. 
      White-matter changes in patients with Alzheimer's disease could not be related to 
      infarction. Pathologic changes in small blood vessels are associated with diffuse 
      white-matter changes and may have a distinct role in the genesis of vascular 
      dementia.

TI  - White matter tauopathy: Transient functional loss and novel myelin remodeling.
PG  - 813-827
LID - 10.1002/glia.23286 [doi]
AB  - Early white matter (WM) changes are common in dementia and may contribute to 
      functional decline. We here examine this phenomenon in an induced dementia model for 
      the first time. We report a novel and selective form of myelin injury as the first 
      manifestation of tauopathy in the adult central nervous system. Myelin pathology 
      rapidly followed the induction of a P301 tau mutation associated with 
      fronto-temporal dementia in humans (rTG4510 line). Damage involved focal disruption 
      of the ad-axonal myelin lamella and internal oligodendrocyte tongue process, 
      followed by myelin remodeling with features of re-myelination that included myelin 
      thinning and internodal shortening. The evolution of the re-myelinated phenotype was 
      complete in the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus after 1 month and in the optic 
      nerve (ON) after 9 months of transgene induction and proceeded in the absence of 
      actual demyelination, reactive glial changes or inflammatory response. The initial 
      rapid myelin pathology was associated with loss of WM function and performance 
      decline in a novel recognition test and both these effects largely reversed during 
      the myelin re-modeling phase. The initial phase of myelin injury was accompanied by 
      disruption of the vesicle population present in the axoplasm of hippocampal and ON 
      axons. Axoplasmic vesicle release is significant for the regulation of myelin 
      plasticity and disruption of this pathway may underlie the myelin damage and 
      remodeling evoked by tauopathy. WM dysfunction early in tauopathy will disorder 
      neural circuits, the current findings suggest this event may make a significant 
      contribution to early clinical deficit in dementia.

TI  - The identity of lacunar dementia and Binswanger disease.
PG  - 389-91
AB  - It is postulated here that the dementia occurring in patients with lacunar strokes 
      is due to an ischemic leukoencephalopathy. Severity of the dementia correlates, not 
      with the volume of brain tissue lost from large-artery infarctions, but rather, with 
      the extent of cortex disconnection resulting from demyelination. The term Lacunar 
      Dementia is proposed, instead of the poorly known eponym "Binswanger disease" or the 
      cumbersome descriptive name "subcortical arteriosclerotic encephalopathy." 
      Clinically, Lacunar Dementia presents with gait difficulties, urinary incontinence, 
      parkinsonian features, pseudobulbar palsy, emotional incontinence and dementia. 
      High-resolution CT scan shows decrease density of frontal and periventricular white 
      matter, without contrast enhancement; ventricular dilation, and lacunar infarcts. 
      Small-artery disease lipohyalinosis is the cause of the lacunes and the 
      leukoencephalopathy. Since the advent of the high-resolution CT scan, the frequency 
      of lacunar dementia seems to be increasing, in contrast with the number of cases of 
      multi-infarct dementia.

TI  - The Biology of Glial Cells and Their Complex Roles in Alzheimer's Disease: New 
      Opportunities in Therapy.
LID - 10.3390/biom8030093 [doi]
LID - 93
AB  - Even though Alzheimer's disease (AD) is of significant interest to the scientific 
      community, its pathogenesis is very complicated and not well-understood. A great 
      deal of progress has been made in AD research recently and with the advent of these 
      new insights more therapeutic benefits may be identified that could help patients 
      around the world. Much of the research in AD thus far has been very neuron-oriented; 
      however, recent studies suggest that glial cells, i.e., microglia, astrocytes, 
      oligodendrocytes, and oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (NG2 glia), are linked to the 
      pathogenesis of AD and may offer several potential therapeutic targets against AD. 
      In addition to a number of other functions, glial cells are responsible for 
      maintaining homeostasis (i.e., concentration of ions, neurotransmitters, etc.) 
      within the central nervous system (CNS) and are crucial to the structural integrity 
      of neurons. This review explores the: (i) role of glial cells in AD pathogenesis; 
      (ii) complex functionalities of the components involved; and (iii) potential 
      therapeutic targets that could eventually lead to a better quality of life for AD 
      patients.

TI  - Altered expression of claudin family proteins in Alzheimer's disease and vascular 
      dementia brains.
PG  - 1088-100

AB  - Claudins (Cls) are a multigene family of transmembrane proteins with different 
      tissue distribution, which have an essential role in the formation and sealing 
      capacity of tight junctions (TJs). At the level of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), 
      TJs are the main molecular structures which separate the neuronal milieu from the 
      circulatory space, by a restriction of the paracellular flow of water, ions and 
      larger molecules into the brain. Different studies suggested recently significant 
      BBB alterations in both vascular and degenerative dementia types. In a previous 
      study we found in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and vascular dementia (VaD) brains an 
      altered expression of occludin, a molecular partner of Cls in the TJs structure. 
      Therefore in this study, using an immunohistochemical approach, we investigated the 
      expression of Cl family proteins (Cl-2, Cl-5 and Cl-11) in frontal cortex of aged 
      control, AD and VaD brains. To estimate the number of Cl-expressing cells, we 
      applied a random systematic sampling and the unbiased optical fractionator method. 
      We found selected neurons, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes and endothelial cells 
      expressing Cl-2, Cl-5 and Cl-11 at detectable levels in all cases studied. We report 
      a significant increase in ratio of neurons expressing Cl-2, Cl-5 and Cl-11 in both 
      AD and VaD as compared to aged controls. The ratio of astrocytes expressing Cl-2 and 
      Cl-11 was significantly higher in AD and VaD as compared to aged controls. The ratio 
      of oligodendrocytes expressing Cl-11 was significantly higher in AD and the ratio of 
      oligodendrocytes expressing Cl-2 was significantly higher in VaD as compared to aged 
      controls. Within the cerebral cortex, Cls were selectively expressed by pyramidal 
      neurons, which are the ones responsible for cognitive processes and affected by AD 
      pathology. Our findings suggest a new function of Cl family proteins which might be 
      linked to response to cellular stress.

TI  - Phosphodiesterase III inhibition promotes differentiation and survival of 
      oligodendrocyte progenitors and enhances regeneration of ischemic white matter 
      lesions in the adult mammalian brain.
PG  - 299-310
LID - 10.1038/jcbfm.2009.210 [doi]
AB  - Vascular dementia is caused by blockage of blood supply to the brain, which causes 
      ischemia and subsequent lesions primarily in the white matter, a key characteristic 
      of the disease. In this study, we used a chronic cerebral hypoperfusion rat model to 
      show that the regeneration of white matter damaged by hypoperfusion is enhanced by 
      inhibiting phosphodiesterase III. A rat model of chronic cerebral hypoperfusion was 
      prepared by bilateral common carotid artery ligation. Performance at the Morris 
      water-maze task, immunohistochemistry for bromodeoxyuridine, as well as serial 
      neuronal and glial markers were analyzed until 28 days after hypoperfusion. There 
      was a significant increase in the number of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells in the 
      brains of patients with vascular dementia as well as in rats with cerebral 
      hypoperfusion. The oligodendrocyte progenitor cells subsequently underwent cell 
      death and the number of oligodendrocytes decreased. In the rat model, treatment with 
      a phosphodiesterase III inhibitor prevented cell death, markedly increased the 
      mature oligodendrocytes, and promoted restoration of white matter and recovery of 
      cognitive decline. These effects were cancelled by using protein kinase A/C 
      inhibitor in the phosphodiesterase III inhibitor group. The results of our study 
      indicate that the mammalian brain white matter tissue has the capacity to regenerate 
      after ischemic injury.

AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD), dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB), and multiple system 
      atrophy (MSA) are three major synucleinopathies characterized by 
      α-synuclein-containing inclusions in the brains of patients. Because the cell types 
      and brain structures that are affected vary markedly between the disorders, the 
      patients have different clinical manifestations in addition to some overlapping 
      symptoms, which are the basis for differential diagnosis. Cognitive impairment and 
      depression associated with hippocampal dysfunction are frequently observed in these 
      disorders. While various α-synuclein-containing inclusions are found in the 
      hippocampal formation, increasing evidence supports that small α-synuclein 
      aggregates or oligomers may be the real culprit, causing deficits in 
      neurotransmission and neurogenesis in the hippocampus and related brain regions, 
      which constitute the major mechanism for the hippocampal dysfunctions and associated 
      neuropsychiatric manifestations in synucleinopathies.

AB  - Subcortical white matter stroke (WMS) accounts for 25% of all incidences of stroke 
      and results in severe motor and cognitive disability. WMS stands as the second 
      leading cause of dementia and is immensely prevalent in older adults. In a 
      startlingly statistic, a majority of human beings will present WMS by 80 years of 
      age. Early ischemic lesions produced by WMS are asymptomatic and termed "silent 
      strokes". WMS is, however, progressive with both the size of the lesions and their 
      distribution, increasing as patients age. Pathological analyses in both postmortem 
      human tissue samples and mouse models of WMS demonstrate myelin degeneration as a 
      chief hallmark of WMS. This suggests that the development of rehabilitative 
      strategies in human WMS will necessitate an understanding of the pathophysiology of 
      demyelination and remyelination following ischemic injury. This review will address 
      our current understanding of WMS from human imaging studies, the development of 
      rodent models of WMS, the mechanistic underpinning of myelin degeneration following 
      WMS as well as remyelination dynamics in the adult brain.

TI  - Occludin is overexpressed in Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia.
PG  - 569-79
AB  - The tight junctions (TJs) are key players in the control of blood-brain barrier 
      (BBB) properties, the most complex TJs in the vascular system being found in the 
      endothelial cells of brain capillaries. One of the main TJs proteins is occludin, 
      which anchors plasma membranes of neighbour cells and is present in large amounts in 
      the brain endothelia. Previous studies demonstrated that disruption of BBB in 
      various pathological situations associates with changes in occludin expression, and 
      this change could be responsible for malfunction of BBB. Therefore in this study, 
      applying an immunohistochemical approach, we decided to explore the occludin 
      expression in frontal cortex (FC) and basal ganglia in ageing control, Alzheimer's 
      disease (AD), and vascular dementia (VD) brains, as far as all these pathologies 
      associate microangiopathy and disruption of BBB. Strikingly, we found selected 
      neurons, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes expressing occludin, in all cases studied. 
      To estimate the number of occludin-expressing neurons, we applied a stereological 
      approach with random systematic sampling and the unbiased optical fractionator 
      method. We report here a significant increase in ratio of occludin-expressing 
      neurons in FC and basal ganglia regions in both AD and VD as compared to ageing 
      controls. Within the cerebral cortex, occludin was selectively expressed by 
      pyramidal neurons, which are the ones responsible for cognitive processes and 
      affected by AD pathology. Our findings could be important in unravelling new 
      pathogenic pathways in dementia disorders and new functions of occludin and TJs.

TI  - Subcortical ischemic vascular disease: Roles of oligodendrocyte function in 
      experimental models of subcortical white-matter injury.
PG  - 187-98
AB  - Oligodendrocytes are one of the major cell types in cerebral white matter. Under 
      normal conditions, they form myelin sheaths that encircle axons to support fast 
      nerve conduction. Under conditions of cerebral ischemia, oligodendrocytes tend to 
      die, resulting in white-matter dysfunction. Repair of white matter involves the 
      ability of oligodendrocyte precursors to proliferate and mature. However, 
      replacement of lost oligodendrocytes may not be the only mechanism for white-matter 
      recovery. Emerging data now suggest that coordinated signaling between neural, 
      glial, and vascular cells in the entire neurovascular unit may be required. In this 
      mini-review, we discuss how oligodendrocyte lineage cells participate in signaling 
      and crosstalk with other cell types to underlie function and recovery in various 
      experimental models of subcortical white-matter injury.

TI  - Dynamic changes in myelin aberrations and oligodendrocyte generation in chronic 
      amyloidosis in mice and men.
PG  - 273-86
LID - 10.1002/glia.22432 [doi]
AB  - Myelin loss is frequently observed in human Alzheimer's disease (AD) and may 
      constitute to AD-related cognitive decline. A potential source to repair myelin 
      defects are the oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) present in an adult brain. 
      However, until now, little is known about the reaction of these cells toward amyloid 
      plaque deposition neither in human AD patients nor in the appropriate mouse models. 
      Therefore, we analyzed cells of the oligodendrocyte lineage in a mouse model with 
      chronic plaque deposition (APPPS1 mice) and samples from human patients. In APPPS1 
      mice defects in myelin integrity and myelin amount were prevalent at 6 months of age 
      but normalized to control levels in 9-month-old mice. Concomitantly, we observed an 
      increase in the proliferation and differentiation of OPCs in the APPPS1 mice at this 
      specific time window (6-8 months) implying that improvements in myelin aberrations 
      may result from repair mechanisms mediated by OPCs. However, while we observed a 
      higher number of cells of the oligodendrocyte lineage (Olig2+ cells) in APPPS1 mice, 
      OLIG2+ cells were decreased in number in postmortem human AD cortex. Our data 
      demonstrate that oligodendrocyte progenitors specifically react to amyloid plaque 
      deposition in an AD-related mouse model as well as in human AD pathology, although 
      with distinct outcomes. Strikingly, possible repair mechanisms from newly generated 
      oligodendrocytes are evident in APPPS1 mice, whereas a similar reaction of 
      oligodendrocyte progenitors seems to be strongly limited in final stages of human AD 
      pathology.

LID - 10.1177/1352458515604382 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: We report a comprehensive clinical, radiological, 
      neuropsychometric and pathological evaluation of a woman with a clinical diagnosis 
      of AD dementia (ADem), but whose autopsy demonstrated widespread demyelination, 
      without Alzheimer disease (AD) pathology. METHODS AND RESULTS: Initial 
      neuropsychometric evaluation suggested amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI). 
      Serial magnetic resonance images (MRI) images demonstrated the rate of increase in 
      her ventricular volume was comparable to that of 46 subjects with aMCI who 
      progressed to ADem, without accumulating white matter disease. Myelin 
      immunohistochemistry at autopsy demonstrated extensive cortical subpial 
      demyelination. Subpial lesions involved the upper cortical layers, and often 
      extended through the entire width of the cortex. CONCLUSIONS: Multiple sclerosis 
      (MS) can cause severe cortical dysfunction and mimic ADem. Cortical demyelination is 
      not well detected by standard imaging modalities and may not be detected on autopsy 
      without myelin immunohistochemistry.

AB  - Problems in the literature in the appraisal of brain deep white-matter changes are 
      considered. The identification of the changes with Binswanger's disease alone is 
      rejected, and evidence is reviewed that demonstrates that they are associated with 
      cognitive impairment and, to some extent, with vascular disease. Possible causes of 
      white-matter changes and their relationships to Alzheimer's disease are examined, 
      and it is argued that a neutral term, exact enough to define white-matter changes, 
      sufficient as a description or label, and demanding enough to require precise 
      clinical and imaging descriptions is needed. We suggest herein the term 
      "leuko-araiosis" on the basis of Greek etymology and Hippocratic usage.

TI  - Globular Glial Mixed Four Repeat Tau and TDP-43 Proteinopathy with Motor Neuron 
      Disease and Frontotemporal Dementia.
PG  - 82-94
LID - 10.1111/bpa.12262 [doi]
AB  - Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) may be accompanied by frontotemporal dementia 
      (FTD). We report a case of glial mixed tau and TDP-43 proteinopathies in a Japanese 
      patient diagnosed clinically as having ALS-D. Autopsy revealed loss of lower motor 
      neurons and degeneration of the pyramidal tracts in the spinal cord and brain stem. 
      The brain showed frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), the most severe neuronal 
      loss and gliosis being evident in the precentral gyrus. Although less severe, such 
      changes were also observed in other brain regions, including the basal ganglia and 
      substantia nigra. AT8 immunostaining revealed that predominant occurrence of 
      astrocytic tau lesions termed globular astrocytic inclusions (GAIs) was a feature of 
      the affected regions. These GAIs were Gallyas-Braak negative. Neuronal and 
      oligodendrocytic tau lesions were comparatively scarce. pS409/410 immunostaining 
      also revealed similar neuronal and glial TDP-43 lesions. Interestingly, occasional 
      co-localization of tau and TDP-43 was evident in the GAIs. Immunoblot analyses 
      revealed band patterns characteristic of a 4-repeat (4R) tauopathy, corticobasal 
      degeneration and a TDP-43 proteinopathy, ALS/FTLD-TDP Type B. No mutations were 
      found in the MAPT or TDP-43 genes. We consider that this patient harbored a 
      distinct, sporadic globular glial mixed 4R tau and TDP-43 proteinopathy associated 
      with motor neuron disease and FTD.

AB  - We describe a human single-nuclei transcriptomic atlas for the substantia nigra 
      (SN), generated by sequencing approximately 17,000 nuclei from matched cortical and 
      SN samples. We show that the common genetic risk for Parkinson's disease (PD) is 
      associated with dopaminergic neuron (DaN)-specific gene expression, including 
      mitochondrial functioning, protein folding and ubiquitination pathways. We identify 
      a distinct cell type association between PD risk and oligodendrocyte-specific gene 
      expression. Unlike Alzheimer's disease (AD), we find no association between PD risk 
      and microglia or astrocytes, suggesting that neuroinflammation plays a less causal 
      role in PD than AD. Beyond PD, we find associations between SN DaNs and GABAergic 
      neuron gene expression and multiple neuropsychiatric disorders. Conditional analysis 
      reveals that distinct neuropsychiatric disorders associate with distinct sets of 
      neuron-specific genes but converge onto shared loci within oligodendrocytes and 
      oligodendrocyte precursors. This atlas guides our aetiological understanding by 
      associating SN cell type expression profiles with specific disease risk.

AB  - Dysfunction and death of specific neuronal systems are important processes occurring 
      in aging and in Alzheimer's and in Parkinson's disease. The neuropathology and 
      neurochemistry of some of the neuronal systems at risk in these settings are 
      subjects of active research; the nature and consequences of these cellular 
      pathologies have begun to be clarified. The availability of animal models (including 
      aged monkeys, macaques with cholinergic deficiencies, and monkeys with MPTP-induced 
      nigrostriatal pathology, all of which recapitulate certain features of human aging 
      or disease) allow the opportunity to assess the efficacies of new pharmacotherapies, 
      neural grafts, and trophic factors. These approaches can be monitored by behavioral 
      testing and, in some instances, by in vivo imaging methods, which can in turn be 
      correlated with morphologic and chemical analyses of brain. Demonstration of the 
      efficacy of these procedures in nonhuman primates would have profound implications 
      on the development of new therapies designed to alleviate the effects of aging and 
      disease on the human brain.

TI  - Quantification of myelin loss in frontal lobe white matter in vascular dementia, 
      Alzheimer's disease, and dementia with Lewy bodies.
PG  - 579-89
LID - 10.1007/s00401-009-0635-8 [doi]
AB  - The aim of this study was to characterize myelin loss as one of the features of 
      white matter abnormalities across three common dementing disorders. We evaluated 
      post-mortem brain tissue from frontal and temporal lobes from 20 vascular dementia 
      (VaD), 19 Alzheimer's disease (AD) and 31 dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) cases and 
      12 comparable age controls. Images of sections stained with conventional luxol fast 
      blue were analysed to estimate myelin attenuation by optical density. Serial 
      adjacent sections were then immunostained for degraded myelin basic protein (dMBP) 
      and the mean percentage area containing dMBP (%dMBP) was determined as an indicator 
      of myelin degeneration. We further assessed the relationship between dMBP and 
      glutathione S-transferase (a marker of mature oligodendrocytes) immunoreactivities. 
      Pathological diagnosis significantly affected the frontal but not temporal lobe 
      myelin attenuation: myelin density was most reduced in VaD compared to AD and DLB, 
      which still significantly exhibited lower myelin density compared to ageing 
      controls. Consistent with this, the degree of myelin loss was correlated with 
      greater %dMBP, with the highest %dMBP in VaD compared to the other groups. The %dMBP 
      was inversely correlated with the mean size of oligodendrocytes in VaD, whereas it 
      was positively correlated with their density in AD. A two-tier regression model 
      analysis confirmed that the type of disorder (VaD or AD) determines the relationship 
      between %dMBP and the size or density of oligodendrocytes across the cases. Our 
      findings, attested by the use of three markers, suggest that myelin loss may evolve 
      in parallel with shrunken oligodendrocytes in VaD but their increased density in AD, 
      highlighting partially different mechanisms are associated with myelin degeneration, 
      which could originate from hypoxic-ischaemic damage to oligodendrocytes in VaD 
      whereas secondary to axonal degeneration in AD.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease is a progressive, incurable neurodegenerative disease targeting 
      specific neuronal populations within the brain while neighboring neurons appear 
      unaffected. The focus for defining mechanisms has therefore been on the pathogenesis 
      in affected neuronal populations and developing intervention strategies to prevent 
      their cell death. However, there is growing recognition of the importance of glial 
      cells in the development of pathology. Determining exactly how glial cells are 
      involved in the disease process and the susceptibility of the aging brain provides 
      unprecedented challenges. The present review examines recent studies attempting to 
      unravel the glial response during the course of disease and how this action may 
      dictate the outcome of neurodegeneration. The importance of regional heterogeneity 
      of glial cells within the CNS during healthy aging and disease is examined to 
      understand how the glial cells may contribute to neuronal susceptibility or 
      resilience during the neurodegenerative process.-Alibhai, J. D., Diack, A. B.,

      intersection of neuroprotection and neurodegeneration.
PG  - 185-94

AB  - Oligodendrocytes are dependent on an intact, dynamic microtubule (MT) network, which 
      participates in the elaboration and stabilization of myelin forming extensions, and 
      is essential for cellular sorting processes. The microtubule-associated protein tau 
      is constituent of oligodendrocytes. During culture maturation it is developmentally 
      regulated and important for MT stability, MT formation and intracellular 
      trafficking. Downregulation of tau impairs process outgrowth and the transport of 
      myelin basic protein (MBP) mRNA to the cell periphery. Cells fail to differentiate 
      into MBP-expressing, sheet-forming oligodendrocytes. Tau-positive inclusions 
      originating in oligodendrocytes and white matter pathology are prominent in 
      frontotemporal dementias, such as Pick's disease, progressive supranuclear palsy and 
      corticobasal degeneration. An impairment or overload of the proteolytic degradation 
      systems, i.e. the ubiquitin proteasomal system and the lysosomal degradation 
      pathway, has been connected to the formation of protein aggregates. Large protein 
      aggregates are excluded from the proteasome and degraded by autophagy, which is a 
      highly selective process and requires receptor proteins for ubiquitinated proteins, 
      including histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6). HDAC6 is present in oligodendrocytes, and 
      α-tubulin and tau are substrates of HDAC6. In this review our current knowledge of 
      the role of tau and protein aggregate formation in oligodendrocyte cell culture 
      systems is summarized.

TI  - Maturation-dependent sensitivity of oligodendrocyte lineage cells to apoptosis: 
      implications for normal development and disease.
PG  - 1178-86
LID - 10.1038/cdd.2008.70 [doi]
AB  - Apoptosis plays a crucial role in brain development by ensuring that only 
      appropriately growing, migrating, and synapse-forming neurons and their associated 
      glial cells survive. This process involves an intimate relationship between 
      cell-cell interactions and developmental cues and is further impacted by 
      environmental stress during neurogenesis and disease. Oligodendrocytes (OLs), the 
      major myelin-forming cells in the central nervous system, largely form after this 
      wave of neurogenesis but also show a selective vulnerability to cell death stimuli 
      depending on their stage of development. This can affect not only embryonic and 
      early postnatal brain formation but also the response to demyelinating pathologies. 
      In the present review, we discuss the stage-specific sensitivity of OL lineage cells 
      to damage-induced death and how this might impact myelin survival and regeneration 
      during injury or disease.

AB  - Neuronal degeneration is a common mechanism of many neurological diseases including 
      Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), and Multiple Sclerosis (MS). 
      While AD and PD are classical neurodegenerative diseases, the primary pathology in 
      MS is driven by autoimmune inflammation, attacking oligodendrocytes and thereby 
      inducing neurodegeneration. In AD and PD, immune cells are also considered to play 
      an important role in the disease progression. While the role of local central 
      nervous system (CNS) innate immune cells is well described, a potential influence of 
      adaptive immune cells in PD and AD is not yet fully understood.Here, we aim to 
      summarize findings concerning adaptive immune cells in PD pathogenesis and compare 
      them to AD and MS. In the first part, we focus on disease-specific alterations of 
      lymphocytes in the circulating blood. Subsequently, we describe what is known about 
      CNS-infiltrated lymphocytes and mechanisms of their infiltration. Finally, we 
      summarize published data and try to understand the mechanisms of how lymphocytes 
      contribute to neurodegeneration in PD, AD, and MS.Lymphocytes are critically 
      involved in the pathogenesis of MS, and clarifying the role of lymphocytes in PD and 
      AD pathogenesis might lead to an identification of a common signature of lymphocytes 
      in neurodegeneration and thus pave the road towards novel treatment options.

AB  - White matter damage is an important part of cerebrovascular disease and may be a 
      significant contributing factor in vascular mechanisms of cognitive dysfunction and 
      dementia. It is well accepted that white matter homeostasis involves multifactorial 
      interactions between all cells in the axon-glia-vascular unit. But more recently, it 
      has been proposed that beyond cell-cell signaling within the brain per se, dynamic 
      crosstalk between brain and systemic responses such as circulating immune cells and 
      stem/progenitor cells may also be important. In this review, we explore the 
      hypothesis that peripheral cells contribute to damage and repair after white matter 
      damage. Depending on timing, phenotype and context, monocyte/macrophage can possess 
      both detrimental and beneficial effects on oligodendrogenesis and white matter 
      remodeling. Endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) can be activated after CNS injury 
      and the response may also influence white matter repair process. These emerging 
      findings support the hypothesis that peripheral-derived cells can be both 
      detrimental or beneficial in white matter pathology in cerebrovascular disease. This 
      article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Vascular Contributions to Cognitive 
      Impairment and Dementia, edited by M. Paul Murphy, Roderick A. Corriveau and Donna 
      M. Wilcock.

      signaling pathways: implication for HIV-associated dementia.
PG  - 114-25
AB  - HIV-associated dementia (HAD) is a serious neurological disorder affecting about 7% 
      of people with AIDS. In the brain, HIV-1 infects a restricted number of cell types, 
      being primarily present in macrophages and microglial cells, less abundant in 
      astrocytes, and rarely seen in oligodendrocytes and neurons. Lack of a productive 
      HIV-1 infection of neuronal cells suggests the presence of an indirect pathway by 
      which the virus may determine the brain pathology and neuronal dysfunction seen in 
      AIDS patients. Among the participants in this event, viral proteins including gp120 
      and Tat, along with host factors including cytokines, chemokines, and several 
      signaling pathways have received considerable attention. In this article, we discuss 
      the most recent concepts pertaining to the mechanisms of HIV-1-induced neuronal 
      dysfunction by highlighting the interplay between signal transduction pathways 
      activated by viral and host factors and their consequences in neuronal cell 
      function.

      disease and dementia with Lewy bodies.
PG  - 284-94
AB  - TAR-DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) has been identified as a major component protein 
      of ubiquitin-positive inclusions in brains from patients with frontotemporal lobar 
      degeneration with ubiquitin-positive inclusions (FTLD-U) and amyotrophic lateral 
      sclerosis. To obtain the precise prevalence of TDP-43 pathology in neurodegenerative 
      disorders, we examined brains from patients with tauopathies and synucleinopathies 
      as well as FTLD-U using immunohistochemical analysis. Consequently, TDP-43-positive 
      inclusions within neurons and oligodendroglia were found in brains from patients 
      with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) in addition to 
      FTLD-U, but not with Parkinson's disease, Pick's disease, progressive supranuclear 
      palsy, corticobasal degeneration or FTDP-17. The amygdala and hippocampus that were 
      vulnerable to tau or alpha-synuclein pathology demonstrated more severe TDP-43 
      pathology in AD and DLB cases than in FTLD-U cases. In contrast, in the frontal 
      cortex and basal ganglia that were vulnerable to TDP-43 pathology in FTLD-U, TDP-43 
      pathology was not observed in AD and DLB cases. Thus, the neuroanatomical 
      distribution of TDP-43 pathology in AD and DLB cases was obviously different from 
      that in FTLD-U cases. Furthermore, a subset of TDP-43-positive inclusions co-existed 
      with neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) or Lewy bodies (LBs) in the same neurons. Upon 
      double-immunofluorescent labeling analysis, TDP-43 was hardly superimposed with tau, 
      while TDP-43 was partially superimposed with alpha-synuclein, suggesting that 
      neither NFTs nor LBs themselves show TDP-43 immunoreactivity and that TDP-43 
      pathology found in this study may be related in some way to AD and LB pathology. 
      This study will provide a more in-depth understanding of the various pathogenic 
      pathways leading to neurodegenerative disorders.

AB  - The relationship between depression and Alzheimer's disease (AD) has always been 
      relevant and controversial. Here, we briefly review epidemiological and biological 
      studies that have investigated these disorders and then introduce our recent 
      research about postmortem brains from patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). 
      Our novel methodological approaches have revealed that MDD may be associated with an 
      unknown type of myelin/myelination abnormalities in the frontopolar cortex. Based 
      mainly on our findings, as well as on neuropathological observations by Braak and 
      Braak (Acta Neuropathol 9, 197-201, 1996), we discuss the possible existence of an 
      as yet unknown common mechanism linking the pathophysiologies underlying both 
      depression and AD.

TI  - PPARs in the central nervous system: roles in neurodegeneration and 
      neuroinflammation.
PG  - 2046-2069
LID - 10.1111/brv.12320 [doi]
AB  - Over 25 years have passed since peroxisome proliferators-activated receptors 
      (PPARs), were first described. Like other members of the nuclear receptors 
      superfamily, PPARs have been defined as critical sensors and master regulators of 
      cellular metabolism. Recognized as ligand-activated transcription factors, they are 
      involved in lipid, glucose and amino acid metabolism, taking part in different 
      cellular processes, including cellular differentiation and apoptosis, inflammatory 
      modulation and attenuation of acute and chronic neurological damage in vivo and in 
      vitro. Interestingly, PPAR activation can simultaneously reprogram the immune 
      response, stimulate metabolic and mitochondrial functions, promote axonal growth, 
      induce progenitor cells to differentiate into myelinating oligodendrocytes, and 
      improve brain clearance of toxic molecules such as β-amyloid peptide. Although the 
      molecular mechanisms and cross-talk with different molecular pathways are still the 
      focus of intense research, PPARs are considered potential therapeutic targets for 
      several neuropathological conditions, including degenerative disorders such as 
      Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and Huntington's disease. This review considers recent 
      advances regarding PPARs, as well as new PPAR agonists. We focus on the mechanisms 
      behind the neuroprotective effects exerted by PPARs and summarise the roles of PPARs 
      in different pathologies of the central nervous system, especially those associated 
      with degenerative and inflammatory mechanisms.

TI  - Cellular glutathione peroxidase in human brain: cellular distribution, and its 
      potential role in the degradation of Lewy bodies in Parkinson's disease and dementia 
      with Lewy bodies.
PG  - 63-73
LID - 10.1007/s00401-008-0438-3 [doi]
AB  - Glutathione peroxidase (GPx-1) is regarded as one of the mammalian cell's main 
      antioxidant enzymes inactivating hydrogen peroxide and protecting against oxidative 
      stress. Using control, Parkinson's disease (PD), and dementia with Lewy bodies 
      tissue (DLB) we have shown that GPx-1 is a 21-kD protein under reducing conditions 
      in all tissues examined but is not in high abundance in human brain. Using 
      immunohistochemistry we have mapped the cellular distribution of GPx-1 and have 
      shown it to be in highest levels in microglia and with lower levels in neurons. Only 
      a trace amount was detectable in astrocytes using immunofluorescence and GPx-1 was 
      not detectable in oligodendrocytes. GPx-1 positive microglia were hypertrophied and 
      more abundant in PD and DLB tissues and were seen to be making multiple contacts 
      with neurons. In some cases neurons containing Lewy bodies were surrounded by 
      microglia. Unstructured Lewy bodies were enveloped with a layer of GPx-1 that was 
      partially colocalized with alpha-synuclein whereas concentric Lewy bodies had 
      discrete deposits of GPx-1 around the periphery which appeared to be involved in the 
      degradation of the Lewy bodies. These results suggest that abnormal alpha-synuclein 
      as found in Lewy bodies produce hydrogen peroxide and these neurons are capable of 
      directing antioxidant enzymes to regions of oxidative stress. These results also 
      suggest that GPx-1 positive microglia are involved in neuroprotection in PD and DLB 
      and that GPx-1 is an important antioxidant enzyme in neuronal defences.

AB  - Communication in the central nervous system (CNS) occurs through initiation and 
      propagation of action potentials at excitable domains along axons. Action potentials 
      generated at the axon initial segment (AIS) are regenerated at nodes of Ranvier 
      through the process of saltatory conduction. Proper formation and maintenance of the 
      molecular structure at the AIS and nodes are required for sustaining conduction 
      fidelity. In myelinated CNS axons, paranodal junctions between the axolemma and 
      myelinating oligodendrocytes delineate nodes of Ranvier and regulate the 
      distribution and localization of specialized functional elements, such as 
      voltage-gated sodium channels and mitochondria. Disruption of excitable domains and 
      altered distribution of functional elements in CNS axons is associated with 
      demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis, and is likely a mechanism common 
      to other neurological disorders. This review will provide a brief overview of the 
      molecular structure of the AIS and nodes of Ranvier, as well as the distribution of 
      mitochondria in myelinated axons. In addition, this review highlights important 
      structural and functional changes within myelinated CNS axons that are associated 
      with neurological dysfunction.

TI  - Complex and differential glial responses in Alzheimer's disease and ageing.
PG  - 343-58
AB  - Glial cells and their association with neurones are fundamental for brain function. 
      The emergence of complex neurone-glial networks assures rapid information transfer, 
      creating a sophisticated circuitry where both types of neural cells work in concert, 
      serving different activities. All glial cells, represented by astrocytes, 
      oligodendrocytes, microglia and NG2-glia, are essential for brain homeostasis and 
      defence. Thus, glia are key not only for normal central nervous system (CNS) 
      function, but also to its dysfunction, being directly associated with all forms of 
      neuropathological processes. Therefore, the progression and outcome of neurological 
      and neurodegenerative diseases depend on glial reactions. In this review, we provide 
      a concise account of recent data obtained from both human material and animal models 
      demonstrating the pathological involvement of glia in neurodegenerative processes, 
      including Alzheimer's disease (AD), as well as physiological ageing.

AB  - α-Synucleinopathies (ASP) comprise adult-onset, progressive neurodegenerative 
      disorders such as Parkinson's disease (PD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and 
      multiple system atrophy (MSA) that are characterized by α-synuclein (AS) aggregates 
      in neurons or glia. PD and DLB feature neuronal AS-positive inclusions termed Lewy 
      bodies (LB) whereas glial cytoplasmic inclusions (GCIs, Papp-Lantos bodies) are 
      recognized as the defining hallmark of MSA. Furthermore, AS-positive cytoplasmic 
      aggregates may also be seen in astroglial cells of PD/DLB and MSA brains. The glial 
      AS-inclusions appear to trigger reduced trophic support resulting in neuronal loss. 
      Moreover, microgliosis and astrogliosis can be found throughout the 
      neurodegenerative brain and both are key players in the initiation and progression 
      of ASP. In this review, we will highlight AS-dependent alterations of glial function 
      and their impact on neuronal vulnerability thereby providing a detailed summary on 
      the multifaceted role of glia in ASP.

AB  - Previous MRI studies reported cortical iron accumulation in early-onset (EOAD) 
      compared to late-onset (LOAD) Alzheimer disease patients. However, the pattern and 
      origin of iron accumulation is poorly understood. This study investigated the 
      histopathological correlates of MRI contrast in both EOAD and LOAD. T2*-weighted MRI 
      was performed on postmortem frontal cortex of controls, EOAD, and LOAD. Images were 
      ordinally scored using predefined criteria followed by histology. Nonlinear 
      histology-MRI registration was used to calculate pixel-wise spatial correlations 
      based on the signal intensity. EOAD and LOAD were distinguishable based on 7T MRI 
      from controls and from each other. Histology-MRI correlation analysis of the pixel 
      intensities showed that the MRI contrast is best explained by increased iron 
      accumulation and changes in cortical myelin, whereas amyloid and tau showed less 
      spatial correspondence with T2*-weighted MRI. Neuropathologically, subtypes of 
      Alzheimer's disease showed different patterns of iron accumulation and cortical 
      myelin changes independent of amyloid and tau that may be detected by high-field 
      susceptibility-based MRI.

AB  - Synapses are the functional connection between neurons which are necessary for the 
      transfer of electric activity or chemical activity from one cell to another. 
      Synapses are formed by the pre- and postsynaptic membrane which communicates between 
      pre- and postneurons while a neurochemical modulator is operated in this process. 
      H2S has been known as a toxic gas with rotten eggs smell. However, increasing number 
      of researches show that it regulate a variety of physiological and pathological 
      processes in mammals. Hence, H2S is a physiologically important molecule and has 
      been referred to as the third gaseous molecule alongside carbon monoxide and nitric 
      oxide. The previous era has made an exponential development in the physiological and 
      pathological significance of H2S. Specifically, in the central nervous system, H2S 
      facilitates long-term potentiation and regulates intracellular calcium concentration 
      in brain cells. We as well as others have also shown that H2S has antioxidant, 
      antiapoptotic, and anti-inflammatory properties against various neurodegenerative 
      disorders such as stroke, Alzheimer's disease, and vascular dementia. In this 
      chapter, we highlight the current knowledge of H2S and its neuroprotective effects 
      with a special emphasis on synaptic remodeling.

TI  - A putative functional role for oligodendrocytes in mood regulation.
PG  - e109
LID - 10.1038/tp.2012.34 [doi]
AB  - Altered glial structure and function is implicated in several major mental illnesses 
      and increasing evidence specifically links changes in oligodendrocytes with 
      disrupted mood regulation. Low density and reduced expression of 
      oligodendrocyte-specific gene transcripts in postmortem human subjects points toward 
      decreased oligodendrocyte function in most of the major mental illnesses. Similar 
      features are observed in rodent models of stress-induced depressive-like phenotypes, 
      such as the unpredictable chronic mild stress and chronic corticosterone exposure, 
      suggesting an effect downstream from stress. However, whether oligodendrocyte 
      changes are a causal component of psychiatric phenotypes is not known. Traditional 
      views that identify oligodendrocytes solely as nonfunctional support cells are being 
      challenged, and recent studies suggest a more dynamic role for oligodendrocytes in 
      neuronal functioning than previously considered, with the region adjacent to the 
      node of Ranvier (i.e., paranode) considered a critical region of glial-neuronal 
      interaction. Here, we briefly review the current knowledge regarding oligodendrocyte 
      disruptions in psychiatric disorders and related animal models, with a focus on 
      major depression. We then highlight several rodent studies, which suggest that 
      alterations in oligodendrocyte structure and function can produce behavioral changes 
      that are informative of mood regulatory mechanisms. Together, these studies suggest 
      a model, whereby impaired oligodendrocyte and possibly paranode structure and 
      function can impact neural circuitry, leading to downstream effects related to 
      emotionality in rodents, and potentially to mood regulation in human psychiatric 
      disorders.

TI  - Brain local and regional neuroglial alterations in Alzheimer's Disease: cell types, 
      responses and implications.
PG  - 321-42
AB  - From birth to death, neurons are dynamically accompanied by neuroglial cells in a 
      very close morphological and functional relationship. Three families have been 
      classically considered within the CNS: astroglia, oligodendroglia and microglia. 
      Many types/subtypes (including NGR2+ cells), with a wide variety of physiological 
      and pathological effects on neurons, have been described using morphological and 
      immunocytochemical criteria. Glio-glial, glio-neuronal and neuro-glial cell 
      signaling and gliotransmission are phenomena that are essential to support brain 
      functions. Morphofunctional changes resulting from the plasticity of all the glial 
      cell types parallel the plastic neuronal changes that optimize the functionality of 
      neuronal circuits. Moreover, neuroglia possesses the ability to adopt a reactive 
      status (gliosis) in which, generally, new functions arise to improve and restore if 
      needed the neural functionality. All these features make neuroglial cells elements 
      of paramount importance when attempting to explain any physiological or pathological 
      processes in the CNS, because they are involved in both, neuroprotection/neurorepair 
      and neurodegeneration. There exist diverse and profound, regional and local, 
      neuroglial changes in all involutive processes (physiological and pathological 
      aging; neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer ´s disease -AD-), but today, 
      the exact meaning of such modifications (the modifications of the different 
      neuroglial types, in time and place), is not well understood. In this review we 
      consider the different neuroglial cells and their responses in order to understand 
      the possible role they fulfill in pathogenesis, diagnosis and treatment (preventive 
      or palliative) of AD. The existence of differentiated and/or concurrent pathogenic 
      and neuro-protective/neuro-restorative astroglial and microglial responses is 
      highlighted.

TI  - The role of glia in α-synucleinopathies.
PG  - 575-86
LID - 10.1007/s12035-012-8340-3 [doi]
AB  - α-Synuclein (AS)-positive inclusions are the pathological hallmark of Parkinson's 
      disease (PD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and multiple system atrophy (MSA), all 
      belonging to the category of α-synucleinopathies. α-Synucleinopathies represent 
      progressive neurodegenerative disorders characterised by increasing incidences in 
      the population over the age of 65. The relevance of glial reactivity and dysfunction 
      in α-synucleinopathies is highlighted by numerous experimental evidences. Glial AS 
      inclusion pathology is prominent in oligodendroglia of MSA (glial cytoplasmic 
      inclusions) and is a common finding in astroglial cells of PD and DLB, resulting in 
      specific dysfunctional responses. Involvement of AS-dependent astroglial and 
      microglial activation in neurodegenerative mechanisms, and therefore in disease 
      initiation and progression, has been suggested. The aim of this review is to 
      summarise and discuss the multifaceted responses of glial cells in 
      α-synucleinopathies. The beneficial, as well as detrimental, effects of glial cells 
      on neuronal viability are taken into consideration to draw an integrated picture of 
      glial roles in α-synucleinopathies. Furthermore, an overview on therapeutic 
      approaches outlines the difficulties of translating promising experimental studies 
      into successful clinical trials targeting candidate glial pathomechanisms.

TI  - Apolipoprotein D in the aging brain and in Alzheimer's dementia.
PG  - 330-6
AB  - Apolipoprotein D (apoD) levels were examined in the temporal cortex as well as an 
      assessment of the location of apoD positive cells within the brain by 
      immunohistochemical and biochemical methods in young control (YC), aged control 
      (AC), and Alzheimer's demented (AD) probands. Scattered apoD positive astrocytes and 
      oligodendrocytes were found throughout the white matter by immunohistochemistry. 
      ApoD immunoreactivity was also observed in the cerebellar oligodendrocytes of the YC 
      group. There was faint positive apoD staining in scattered cortical astrocytes and a 
      few neurons in the same group. In contrast, some of the AC and all of the AD 
      probands had intense and frequent apoD immunostained cortical astrocytes and 
      pyramidal neurons. The cortical senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles were apoD 
      immunonegative. No quantitative differences were found between the cortical apoD 
      levels in the AC and AD groups, determined by immunoblotting. ApoD detected in the 
      brain tissue was different in molecular weight (29 kDal) from that seen in CSF or in 
      the serum (32 kDal). Our results indicate apoD is present in the human brain, 
      especially in glial cells, and has increased abundance in the elderly and AD 
      subjects.

TI  - [Argyrophilic grain disease (AgD), a frequent and largely underestimated cause of 
      dementia in old patients].
PG  - 155-65
AB  - Argyrophilic grain disease (AgD) is a late-onset dementia morphologically 
      characterized by abundant neuropil grains (ArGs). ArGs are mainly found in the CA1 
      subfield of the cornu ammonis, entorhinal and transentorhinal cortices, the amygdala 
      and the hypothalamic lateral tuberal nuclei. We have recently shown that abnormally 
      phosphosphorylated tau protein is the main protein constituent of ArGs and that tau 
      is hyperphosphorylated in up to 80p.100 of nerve cels in areas rich in ArGs. We 
      could demonstrate that at least a subset of grains are formed within dendrites and 
      dendritic side-branches of neurons containing hyperphosphylated tau. Morphology of 
      dendrites containing grains suggests that a process of progressive dendritic 
      shrinkage is taking place in neurons bearing ArGs. Furthermore it became apparent 
      that the presence of ArGs is not necessarily associated with a cognitive decline. 
      Our studies on AgD cases with and without dementia suggest that AgD is a progressive 
      neurodegenerative disorder with early subclinical lesions in anterior part of the 
      hippocampal formation. At later stages involvement of more caudal parts of the 
      hippocampal formation generally results in a cognitive decline. Thus, one possible 
      explanation for the dementia observed in some subjects with AgD is that there is a 
      more widepread loss of postsynaptic structures, including synaptic contacts, 
      throughout the hippocampus-entorhinal/parahippocampal complex and the amygdaloid 
      nuclei. Most of the reported AgD cases are associated with neurofibrillary lesions 
      (e.g. neurofibrillary tangles) which are also typical of Alzheimer's disease (AD). 
      However, neurofibrillary changes do not exceed early (entorhinal and limbic) Braak 
      stages which generally are not associated with a cognitive decline. Additional 
      neuropathological features of AgD include oligodendroglial tau filamentous 
      inclusions ( coiled bodies ), ballooned neurons and astrocytic tau pathology. The 
      clinical features of AgD are poorly understood. However, preliminary data from 
      retrospective studies suggest that in AgD behavioural disturbances will precede 
      memory failure and memory decline. Furthermore, it has been shown that the ApoEe4 
      allele does not constitute a risk factor for the development of AgD. In conclusion 
      it seems very likely that AgD is a distinct dementing disorder of old age that has 
      to be distinguished from other tauopathies, e.g. AD, by both morphological and 
      genetic criteria.

LID - 10.3233/JAD-161143 [doi]
AB  - Abnormal iron distribution in the isocortex is increasingly recognized as an in vivo 
      marker for Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the contribution of iron accumulation 
      to the AD pathology is still poorly understood. In this study, we investigated: 1) 
      frontal cortical iron distribution in AD and normal aging and 2) the relation 
      between iron distribution and degree of AD pathology. We used formalin fixed 
      paraffin embedded frontal cortex from 10 AD patients, 10 elder, 10 middle aged, and 
      10 young controls and visualized iron with a modified Perl's histochemical 
      procedure. AD and elderly subjects were not different with respect to age and sex 
      distribution. Iron distribution in the frontal cortex was not affected by normal 
      aging but was clearly different between AD and controls. AD showed accumulation of 
      iron in plaques, activated microglia, and, in the most severe cases, in the 
      mid-cortical layers along myelinated fibers. The degree of altered iron 
      accumulations was correlated to the amount of amyloid-β plaques and tau pathology in 
      the same block, as well as to Braak stage (p < 0.001). AD and normal aging show 
      different iron and myelin distribution in frontal cortex. These changes appear to 
      occur after the development of the AD pathological hallmarks. These findings may 
      help the interpretation of high resolution in vivo MRI and suggest the potential of 
      using changes in iron-based MRI contrast to indirectly determine the degree of AD 
      pathology in the frontal cortex.

TI  - Alzheimer's disease as homeostatic responses to age-related myelin breakdown.
PG  - 1341-71
LID - 10.1016/j.neurobiolaging.2009.08.007 [doi]
AB  - The amyloid hypothesis (AH) of Alzheimer's disease (AD) posits that the fundamental 
      cause of AD is the accumulation of the peptide amyloid beta (Aβ) in the brain. This 
      hypothesis has been supported by observations that genetic defects in amyloid 
      precursor protein (APP) and presenilin increase Aβ production and cause familial AD 
      (FAD). The AH is widely accepted but does not account for important phenomena 
      including recent failures of clinical trials to impact dementia in humans even after 
      successfully reducing Aβ deposits. Herein, the AH is viewed from the broader 
      overarching perspective of the myelin model of the human brain that focuses on 
      functioning brain circuits and encompasses white matter and myelin in addition to 
      neurons and synapses. The model proposes that the recently evolved and extensive 
      myelination of the human brain underlies both our unique abilities and 
      susceptibility to highly prevalent age-related neuropsychiatric disorders such as 
      late onset AD (LOAD). It regards oligodendrocytes and the myelin they produce as 
      being both critical for circuit function and uniquely vulnerable to damage. This 
      perspective reframes key observations such as axonal transport disruptions, 
      formation of axonal swellings/sphenoids and neuritic plaques, and proteinaceous 
      deposits such as Aβ and tau as by-products of homeostatic myelin repair processes. 
      It delineates empirically testable mechanisms of action for genes underlying FAD and 
      LOAD and provides "upstream" treatment targets. Such interventions could potentially 
      treat multiple degenerative brain disorders by mitigating the effects of aging and 
      associated changes in iron, cholesterol, and free radicals on oligodendrocytes and 
      their myelin.

      in addition to neuronal structures. We therefore aimed to determine levels of 
      autoantibodies against amyloid and glial-derived structures in these dementia types. 
      Using a newly developed Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), we measured 
      levels of IgG autoantibodies against neuronal and glial structures in serum and 
      cerebrospinal fluid of a total of 91 subjects (13 PDD, 14 DLB, 11 Alzheimer's 
      disease (AD), 11 frontotemporal dementia (FTD), 11 vascular dementia patients (VaD), 
      and 31 healthy controls). Autoantibody levels against α-synuclein, amyloid-β₄₂ 
      (Aβ₄₂), myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG), myelin basic protein (MBP), and 
      S100B were determined. In all groups, autoantibody levels were about three 
      magnitudes higher in serum than in CSF. Serum autoantibody levels against 
      α-synuclein, Aβ₄₂, MOG, MBP, and S100B were higher in PDD/DLB compared to 
      tau-associated dementias (AD, FTD), VaD, and controls, respectively, with most of 
      them reaching highly significant p-values. In cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), levels of 
      antibodies against oligodendrocyte-derived antigens (MOG, MBP) were significantly 
      increased in PDD/DLB. Increased levels of autoantibodies against both neuronal- and 
      glial-derived antigens in serum and CSF of Lewy body-associated dementias indicate 
      an altered activity of the adaptive immune system in these dementia types. The 
      potential of neural-derived IgG autoantibodies as part of a biomarker panel for the 
      diagnosis of Lewy body-associated dementias should be further evaluated.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Most of the animal models commonly used for preclinical research into 
      Alzheimer's disease (AD) largely fail to address the pathophysiology, including the 
      impact of known risk factors, of the widely diagnosed sporadic form of the disease. 
      Here, we use a transgenic rat (APP21) that does not develop AD-like pathology 
      spontaneously with age, but does develop pathology following vascular stress. To 
      further the potential of this novel rat model as a much-needed pre-clinical animal 
      model of sporadic AD, we characterize APP21 transgenic rats behaviorally and 
      histologically up to 19 months of age. METHODS: The open field test was used as a 
      measure of activity; and the Morris water maze was used to assess learning, memory, 
      and strategy shift. Neuronal loss and microglia activation were also assessed 
      throughout the brain. RESULTS: APP21 transgenic rats showed deficits in working 
      memory from an early age, yet memory recall performance after 24 and 72 h was equal 
      to that of wildtype rats and did not deteriorate with age. A deficit in strategy 
      shift was observed at 19 months of age in APP21 transgenic rats compared to Fischer 
      wildtype rats. Histologically, APP21 transgenic rats demonstrated accelerated white 
      matter inflammation compared to wildtype rats, but interestingly no differences in 
      neuron loss were observed. CONCLUSIONS: The combined presence of white matter 
      pathology and executive function deficits mirrored what is often found in patients 
      with mild cognitive impairment or early dementia, and suggests that this rat model 
      will be useful for translationally meaningful studies into the development and 
      prevention of sporadic AD. The presence of widespread white matter inflammation as 
      the only observed pathological correlate for cognitive deficits raises new questions 
      as to the role of neuroinflammation in cognitive decline.

TI  - Uncoupling N-acetylaspartate from brain pathology: implications for Canavan disease 
      gene therapy.
PG  - 95-113
LID - 10.1007/s00401-017-1784-9 [doi]
AB  - N-Acetylaspartate (NAA) is the second most abundant organic metabolite in the brain, 
      but its physiological significance remains enigmatic. Toxic NAA accumulation appears 
      to be the key factor for neurological decline in Canavan disease-a fatal 
      neurometabolic disorder caused by deficiency in the NAA-degrading enzyme 
      aspartoacylase. To date clinical outcome of gene replacement therapy for this 
      spongiform leukodystrophy has not met expectations. To identify the target tissue 
      and cells for maximum anticipated treatment benefit, we employed comprehensive 
      phenotyping of novel mouse models to assess cell type-specific consequences of NAA 
      depletion or elevation. We show that NAA-deficiency causes neurological deficits 
      affecting unconscious defensive reactions aimed at protecting the body from external 
      threat. This finding suggests, while NAA reduction is pivotal to treat Canavan 
      disease, abrogating NAA synthesis should be avoided. At the other end of the 
      spectrum, while predicting pathological severity in Canavan disease mice, increased 
      brain NAA levels are not neurotoxic per se. In fact, in transgenic mice 
      overexpressing the NAA synthesising enzyme Nat8l in neurons, supra-physiological NAA 
      levels were uncoupled from neurological deficits. In contrast, elimination of 
      aspartoacylase expression exclusively in oligodendrocytes elicited Canavan disease 
      like pathology. Although conditional aspartoacylase deletion in oligodendrocytes 
      abolished expression in the entire CNS, the remaining aspartoacylase in peripheral 
      organs was sufficient to lower NAA levels, delay disease onset and ameliorate 
      histopathology. However, comparable endpoints of the conditional and complete 
      aspartoacylase knockout indicate that optimal Canavan disease gene replacement 
      therapies should restore aspartoacylase expression in oligodendrocytes. On the basis 
      of these findings we executed an ASPA gene replacement therapy targeting 
      oligodendrocytes in Canavan disease mice resulting in reversal of pre-existing CNS 
      pathology and lasting neurological benefits. This finding signifies the first 
      successful post-symptomatic treatment of a white matter disorder using an 
      adeno-associated virus vector tailored towards oligodendroglial-restricted transgene 
      expression.

TI  - Decreased levels of PDI and P5 in oligodendrocytes in Alzheimer's disease.
PG  - 495-501
LID - 10.1111/neup.12395 [doi]
AB  - Protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) is a chaperone protein located in the endoplasmic 
      reticulum (ER). Nitric oxide-induced S-nitrosylation of PDI inhibits its enzymatic 
      activity, leading to protein accumulation and activation of the unfolded protein 
      response. Protein disulfide isomerase P5 (P5) is a member of the PDI family that 
      mostly localizes to the ER lumen. Both S-nitrosylated PDI and S-nitrosylated P5 are 
      found in Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain. Previously, we showed that expression of 
      the ER stress marker, growth arrest, and DNA damage protein (GADD34) was 
      significantly increased in neurons and oligodendrocytes in AD brain. In the present 
      study, we showed that PDI and P5 levels were significantly decreased in 
      oligodendrocytes in the brains of AD patients and an AD mouse model. Interestingly, 
      these decreases were evident before the animals displayed typical AD pathology. 
      Because we previously showed that small short interfering RNA knockdown of PDI or P5 
      could affect the viability of neuronal cells under ER stress, dysfunction of PDI and 
      P5 under ER stress could cause apoptosis of neuronal cells. In summary, we showed 
      that the levels of PDI and P5 were significantly decreased in the oligodendrocytes 
      of AD patients. This phenomenon was also found in an AD mouse model before the 
      animals displayed AD pathology. The overall findings suggest that oligodendrocytes 
      may play important roles in AD pathogenesis.

TI  - Apolipoprotein E genotype and age-related myelin breakdown in healthy individuals: 
      implications for cognitive decline and dementia.
PG  - 63-72
AB  - CONTEXT: Apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype is the most influential Alzheimer disease 
      (AD) risk factor after advanced age. The APOE4 alleles decrease and the APOE2 
      alleles increase age at onset of AD. Human and nonhuman primate data suggest that in 
      midlife, the structural integrity of myelin sheaths begins breaking down, with an 
      accelerating age-related trajectory most evident in the brain's later-myelinating 
      association regions. This may result in a progressive "disconnection" of widely 
      distributed neural networks that may underlie the age risk factor for AD. OBJECTIVE: 
      To assess, using magnetic resonance imaging, whether the shift in age at onset of AD 
      observed with the APOE genotype is associated with the trajectory of age-related 
      myelin breakdown. DESIGN: Cross-sectional. SETTING: Metropolitan university medical 
      center. PARTICIPANTS: Healthy individuals (N = 104) aged 55 to 75 years who 
      underwent genotyping for APOE. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Calculated transverse 
      relaxation rates, an indirect measure of white matter structural integrity, for 
      late-myelinating frontal lobe white matter (Fwm) and early- and later-myelinating 
      regions of the corpus callosum, the splenium (Swm) and the genu (Gwm). RESULTS: The 
      presence of the protective APOE2 allele was associated with significantly higher 
      relaxation rates in Fwm and Gwm but not in Swm. Furthermore, APOE status impacted 
      the trajectory of age-related myelin breakdown in late-myelinating regions (Fwm and 
      Gwm) but not in Swm. In Fwm and Gwm, APOE4+ individuals had a steeper slope of 
      decline in relaxation rates with age than APOE2+ individuals; those with APOE3/3 
      alleles had an intermediate slope. CONCLUSIONS: In later-myelinating regions, the 
      severity and rate of myelin breakdown in healthy older individuals are associated 
      with APOE status and support the hypothesis that this process may contribute to age 
      at onset of AD. Combining APOE status with noninvasive measures of myelin breakdown 
      may be useful in assessing treatment strategies for the primary prevention of AD.

TI  - Diaphanous 1 (DIAPH1) is Highly Expressed in the Aged Human Medial Temporal Cortex 
      and Upregulated in Myeloid Cells During Alzheimer's Disease.
PG  - 995-1007
LID - 10.3233/JAD-180088 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) is linked to 
      cellular stress and inflammation during Alzheimer's disease (AD). RAGE signals 
      through Diaphanous-1 (DIAPH1); however, the expression of DIAPH1 in the healthy and 
      AD human brain has yet to be methodically addressed. OBJECTIVE: To delineate the 
      cell- and disease-state specific expression of DIAPH1 in the human medial temporal 
      cortex during healthy aging and AD. METHODS: We used semi-quantitative 
      immunohistochemistry in the human medial temporal cortex paired with widefield and 
      confocal microscopy and automated analyses to determine colocalization and relative 
      expression of DIAPH1 with key cell markers and molecules in the brains of subjects 
      with AD versus age-matched controls. RESULTS: We report robust colocalization of 
      DIAPH1 with myeloid cells and increased expression during AD, which strongly 
      correlated to increased neutral lipids and morphology of inflamed myeloid cells. 
      DIAPH1 moderately colocalized with markers of endothelial cells, astrocytes, 
      neurons, and oligodendrocytes. DISCUSSION: Our findings localize DIAPH1 particularly 
      to myeloid cells in the CNS, especially in AD in the locations of lipid droplet 
      accumulation, thereby implicating RAGE-DIAPH1 signaling in dysregulated lipid 
      metabolism and morphological changes of inflamed myeloid cells in this disorder.

TI  - The superficial white matter in Alzheimer's disease.
PG  - 1321-34
LID - 10.1002/hbm.23105 [doi]
AB  - White matter abnormalities have been shown in the large deep fibers of Alzheimer's 
      disease patients. However, the late myelinating superficial white matter comprised 
      of intracortical myelin and short-range association fibers has not received much 
      attention. To investigate this area, we extracted a surface corresponding to the 
      superficial white matter beneath the cortex and then applied a cortical 
      pattern-matching approach which allowed us to register and subsequently sample 
      diffusivity along thousands of points at the interface between the gray matter and 
      white matter in 44 patients with Alzheimer's disease (Age: 71.02 ± 5.84, 16M/28F) 
      and 47 healthy controls (Age 69.23 ± 4.45, 19M/28F). In patients we found an overall 
      increase in the axial and radial diffusivity across most of the superficial white 
      matter (P < 0.001) with increases in diffusivity of more than 20% in the bilateral 
      parahippocampal regions and the temporal and frontal lobes. Furthermore, diffusivity 
      correlated with the cognitive deficits measured by the Mini-Mental State Examination 
      scores (P < 0.001). The superficial white matter has a unique microstructure and is 
      critical for the integration of multimodal information during brain maturation and 
      aging. Here we show that there are major abnormalities in patients and the 
      deterioration of these fibers relates to clinical symptoms in Alzheimer's disease.

TI  - Myelin loss in white matter hyperintensities and normal-appearing white matter of 
      cognitively impaired patients: a quantitative synthetic magnetic resonance imaging 
      study.
PG  - 4914-4921
LID - 10.1007/s00330-018-5836-x [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: White matter hyperintensities (WMHs) are implicated in the etiology of 
      dementia. The underlying pathology of WMHs involves myelin and axonal loss due to 
      chronic ischemia. We investigated myelin loss in WMHs and normal-appearing white 
      matter (NAWM) in patients with various degrees of cognitive impairment using 
      quantitative synthetic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). METHODS: We studied 99 
      consecutive patients with cognitive complaints who underwent 3 T brain MRI between 
      July 2016 and August 2017. Myelin partial volume maps were generated with synthetic 
      MRI. Region-of-interest-based analysis was performed on these maps to compare the 
      myelin partial volumes of NAWM and periventricular and deep WMHs. The effects of 
      myelin partial volume of NAWMs on clinical cognitive function were evaluated using 
      multivariate linear regression analysis. RESULTS: WMHs were present in 30.3% of 
      patients. Myelin partial volume in NAWM was lower in patients with WMHs than in 
      those without (37.5 ± 2.7% vs. 39.9 ± 2.4%, p < 0.001). In patients with WMHs, 
      myelin partial volume was highest in NAWMs (median [interquartile range], 37.2% 
      [35.5-39.0%]), followed by deep WMHs (7.2% [3.2-10.5%]) and periventricular WMHs 
      (2.1% [1.1-3.9%], p < 0.001). After adjusting for sex and education years, myelin 
      partial volume in NAWMs was associated with the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale Sum 
      of Box (β = -0.189 [95% CI, -0.380 to -0.012], p = 0.031). CONCLUSION: Myelin loss 
      occurs in both NAWM and WMHs of cognitively impaired patients. Synthetic MRI-based 
      myelin quantification may be a useful imaging marker of cognitive dysfunction in 
      patients with cognitive complaints. KEY POINTS: • Quantitative synthetic MRI allows 
      simultaneous acquisition of conventional MRI and myelin quantification without 
      additional scanning time. • Normal-appearing and hyperintense white matter 
      demonstrate myelin loss in cognitively impaired patients. • This myelin loss 
      partially explains cognitive dysfunction in patients with cognitive complaints.

TI  - Neuropathological spectrum of synucleinopathies.
PG  - S2-12
AB  - Synucleinopathies comprise a diverse group of neurodegenerative proteinopathies that 
      share common pathological lesions composed of aggregates of conformational and 
      posttranslational modifications of alpha-synuclein in selected populations of 
      neurons and glia. Abnormal filamentous aggregates of misfolded alpha-synuclein 
      protein are the major components of Lewy bodies, dystrophic (Lewy) neurites, and the 
      Papp-Lantos filaments in oligodendroglia and neurons in multiple system atrophy 
      linked to degeneration of affected brain regions. The synucleinopathies include (1) 
      Lewy body disorders and dementia with Lewy bodies, (2) multiple system atrophy 
      (MSA), and (3) Hallervorden-Spatz disease. (1) The pathological diagnosis of Lewy 
      body disorders and dementia with Lewy bodies is established by validated consensus 
      criteria based on semiquantitative assessment of subcortical and cortical Lewy 
      bodies as their common hallmarks. They are accompanied by subcortical multisystem 
      degeneration with neuronal loss and gliosis with or without Alzheimer pathologic 
      state. Lewy bodies also occur in numerous other disorders, including pure autonomic 
      failure, neuroaxonal dystrophies, and various amyloidoses and tauopathies. (2) 
      Multiple system atrophy, a sporadic, adult-onset degenerative movement disorder of 
      unknown cause, is characterized by alpha-synuclein-positive glial cytoplasmic and 
      rare neuronal inclusions throughout the central nervous system associated with 
      striatonigral degeneration, olivopontocerebellar atrophy, and involvement of 
      medullar and spinal autonomic nuclei. (3) In neurodegeneration with brain iron 
      accumulation type I, or Hallervorden-Spatz disease, alpha-synuclein is present in 
      axonal spheroids and glial and neuronal inclusions. While the identity of the major 
      components of Lewy bodies suggests that a pathway leading from normal soluble to 
      abnormal misfolded filamentous proteins is central for their pathogenesis, 
      regardless of the primary disorder, there are conformational differences in 
      alpha-synuclein between neuronal and glial aggregates, showing nonuniform mapping 
      for its epitopes. Despite several cellular and transgenic models, it is not clear 
      whether inclusion body formation is an adaptive/neuroprotective or a pathogenic 
      reaction/process generated in response to different, mostly undetermined, functional 
      triggers linked to neurodegeneration.

TI  - Distinct pathological features of the gallyas- and tau-positive glia in the 
      Parkinsonism-dementia complex and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis of Guam.
PG  - 308-16
AB  - We examined 50 patients with parkinsonism-dementia complex of Guam (Guam PDC), 10 
      Guamanian patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), 5 patients with 
      combined PDC and ALS (PDC-ALS), and 20 non-PDC non-ALS Guamanians, who had been 
      autopsied between 1979 and 1982, paying special attention to glial inclusions. 
      Gallyas-positive and tau-immunopositive intracytoplasmic inclusions were observed in 
      many of the glial cells, in addition to extensive neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) in 
      the brains of Guam PDC and PDC-ALS patients. Granular hazy inclusions were seen in 
      the astrocytes, and some crescent/coiled inclusions were observed in the 
      oligodendroglia. Many granular hazy inclusions were observed in the amygdaloid 
      nucleus, inferior olivary nucleus, and lateral funiculus of the spinal cord. The 
      crescent/coiled inclusions were observed predominantly in the anterior nucleus of 
      the thalamus, motor cortex, midbrain tegmentum, pyramids of the medulla oblongata, 
      and lateral funiculus of the spinal cord. The granular hazy inclusions have never 
      been reported previously, and the topographic distribution of the crescent/coiled 
      inclusions in Guam PDC and PDC-ALS differs from those reported previously in other 
      NFT-forming diseases. These findings indicate that Guam PDC and PDC-ALS involve not 
      only neurons but also glia, and that their morphological and topographic differences 
      from other NFT-forming diseases may provide further insights into their distinct 
      etiopathogenesis, and thus prove useful for diagnosis.

AB  - The most notable finding in neurodegenerative diseases is the progressive death of 
      neurones cells. Yet, neuroglial changes can precede and facilitate neuronal loss. 
      This is perhaps expected because astroglial cells maintain the brain homoeostasis, 
      and are responsible for defence and regeneration, so that their malfunction 
      manifested as degeneration or asthenia together with reactivity contribute to 
      pathophysiology. Neuroglia may represent a novel target for therapeutic 
      intervention, be that prevention, slowing progression of or possibly curing 
      neurodegenerative diseases.

      proteomic sequencing of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in 438 older individuals and 
      found associations between cerebral atherosclerosis and reduced synaptic signaling 
      and between RNA splicing and increased oligodendrocyte development and myelination. 
      Consistently, single-cell RNA sequencing showed cerebral atherosclerosis associated 
      with higher oligodendrocyte abundance. A subset of proteins and modules associated 
      with cerebral atherosclerosis was also associated with Alzheimer's disease, 
      suggesting shared mechanisms.

AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder caused 
      by an abnormal expansion of a CAG repeat in the huntingtin gene. Neurodegeneration 
      of striatum and cortex with a severe atrophy at MRI are common findings in HD. The 
      expression of genes involved in the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway such as HMG-CoA 
      reductase and the levels of cholesterol, lanosterol, lathosterol and 
      24S-hydroxycholesterol are reduced in the brain, striatum and cortex in several HD 
      mouse models. Mutant huntingtin affects the maturation and translocation of SREBP 
      and cannot up-regulate LXR. There is a lower synthesis and transport of cholesterol 
      from astrocytes to neurons via ApoE. In primary oligodendrocytes, mutant huntingtin 
      inhibits the regulatory effect of PGC1α on cholesterol metabolism and the expression 
      of Myelin Basic Protein. In humans the decrease of plasma 24S-hydroxycholesterol 
      follows disease progression proportionally to motor and neuropsychiatric 
      dysfunctions and MRI brain atrophy. Huntingtin seems to play a regulatory role in 
      lipid metabolism. Dysregulation of PGC1α and mitochondrial dysfunction may reduce 
      synthesis of Acetyl-CoA and ATP contributing to the cerebral and whole body 
      impairment of cholesterol metabolism.

TI  - Syndromes of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and dementia: relation to transmissible 
      Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.
PG  - 17-26
AB  - A review of over 2,000 cases of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease and related disorders in 
      the literature and our own files yielded 231 cases of dementia with early lower 
      motor neuron signs. The clinical-pathological profiles of the 231 cases were 
      distinctly different from those of cases of transmissible Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease: 
      the patients had a longer illness, and their brains lacked the typical spongiform 
      change. Brain tissue from 33 of these patients has been inoculated intracerebrally 
      into nonhuman primates, but only 2 atypical cases transmitted a spongiform 
      encephalopathy; 23 have been incubating from three to twelve years and can be 
      considered negative transmission experiments. The findings suggest that most cases 
      of dementia associated with early amyotrophy are more closely related to classic 
      amyotrophic lateral sclerosis than to transmissible Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease and do 
      not deserve the label of "amyotrophic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease." When lower motor 
      neuron involvement occurs in transmissible Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, it is usually 
      late and accompanied by signs of a more fulminant cerebral and cerebellar 
      involvement.

TI  - Laquinimod Treatment Improves Myelination Deficits at the Transcriptional and 
      Ultrastructural Levels in the YAC128 Mouse Model of Huntington Disease.
PG  - 4464-4478
LID - 10.1007/s12035-018-1393-1 [doi]
AB  - Laquinimod, an immunomodulatory agent under clinical development for Huntington 
      disease (HD), has recently been shown to confer behavioural improvements that are 
      coupled with prevention of atrophy of the white matter (WM)-rich corpus callosum 
      (CC) in the YAC128 HD mice. However, the nature of the WM improvements is not known 
      yet. Here we investigated the effects of laquinimod on HD-related myelination 
      deficits at the cellular, molecular and ultrastructural levels. We showed that 
      laquinimod treatment improves motor learning and motor function deficits in YAC128 
      HD mice, and confirmed its antidepressant effect even at the lowest dose used. In 
      addition, we demonstrated for the first time the beneficial effects of laquinimod on 
      myelination in the posterior region of the CC where it reversed changes in myelin 
      sheath thickness and rescued Mbp mRNA and protein deficits. Furthermore, the effect 
      of laquinimod on myelin-related gene expression was not region-specific since the 
      levels of the Mbp and Plp1 transcripts were also increased in the striatum. Also, we 
      did not detect changes in immune cell densities or levels of inflammatory genes in 
      3-month-old YAC128 HD mice, and these were not altered with laquinimod treatment. 
      Thus, the beneficial effects of laquinimod on HD-related myelination abnormalities 
      in YAC128 HD mice do not appear to be dependent on its immunomodulatory activity. 
      Altogether, our findings describe the beneficial effects of laquinimod treatment on 
      HD-related myelination abnormalities and highlight its therapeutic potential for the 
      treatment of WM pathology in HD patients.

TI  - Ageing stem and progenitor cells: implications for rejuvenation of the central 
      nervous system.
PG  - 2562-75
LID - 10.1242/dev.092262 [doi]
AB  - The growing burden of the rapidly ageing global population has reinvigorated 
      interest in the science of ageing and rejuvenation. Among organ systems, 
      rejuvenation of the central nervous system (CNS) is arguably the most complex and 
      challenging of tasks owing, among other things, to its startling structural and 
      functional complexity and its restricted capacity for repair. Thus, the prospect of 
      meaningful rejuvenation of the CNS has seemed an impossible goal; however, advances 
      in stem cell science are beginning to challenge this assumption. This Review 
      outlines these advances with a focus on ageing and rejuvenation of key endogenous 
      stem and progenitor cell compartments in the CNS. Insights gleaned from studies of 
      model organisms, chiefly rodents, will be considered in parallel with human studies.

TI  - Neuronal and glial inclusions in frontotemporal dementia with or without motor 
      neuron disease are immunopositive for p62.
PG  - 41-4
AB  - We examined the immunoreactivity of p62 in five cases of frontotemporal dementia 
      (FTD) with ubiquitin-positive, tau-negative inclusions. Only one case had clinical 
      features suggestive of motor neuron disease (MND). In all cases, ubiquitin-positive 
      neuronal inclusions and neurites in the hippocampal region and cerebral neocortex 
      were immunohistochemically positive for p62. Moreover, in the temporal region of a 
      case of FTD with MND, many oligodendrocytes and some astrocytes were positive for 
      p62. These results suggest that the degenerative process involves p62 in FTD and 
      that the process takes place not only in neurons but also in glial cells.

AB  - The oxysterol 25-hydroxycholesterol is a widely used compound displaying an array of 
      pharmacological actions in in vitro systems and cell based experimental systems. In 
      spite of the frequent use of this compound over the last few decades and a large 
      number of studies in vitro and in vivo, its mechanism of formation in vivo is still 
      not well understood. Cholesterol autoxidation does not seem to be an important 
      contributor to in vivo formation of 25-hydroxycholesterol. A number of different 
      cytochrome P450 enzymes such as CYP27A1 and CYP3A4 have been reported to catalyze 
      the conversion of cholesterol to 25-hydroxycholesterol in vitro, but the importance 
      of these reactions in vivo remains unclear. The dioxygenase enzyme cholesterol 
      25-hydroxylase has been shown to generate 25-hydroxycholesterol, but in cholesterol 
      25-hydroxylase knockout mice there are still significant levels of 
      25-hydroxycholesterol in several tissues. This suggests that cholesterol 
      25-hydroxylase is not the sole producer of 25-hydroxycholesterol. The relative 
      importance of different mechanisms of formation of 25-hydroxycholesterol in vivo 
      have still to be elucidated. The maintenance of cholesterol homeostasis is of great 
      importance to supply tissues with the appropriate amount of cholesterol and prevent 
      accumulation that may affect health. Numerous articles mention 25-hydroxycholesterol 
      as an important regulator of cholesterol metabolism. However, mice with a disruption 
      of the cholesterol 25-hydroxylase gene regulate cholesterol metabolism normally and 
      patients with highly elevated levels of 25-hydroxycholesterol also display normal 
      cholesterol and bile acid levels. These reports challenge the hypothesis that 
      25-hydroxycholesterol is an important regulator of cholesterol metabolism. Recent 
      reports suggest that 25-hydroxycholesterol and one of its metabolites may have 
      functions in regulation of humoral immunity. Thus, 25-hydroxycholesterol may be more 
      important as a regulator of immunity than as a regulator of cholesterol metabolism.

AB  - After injury to the central nervous system intrinsic factors such as myelin 
      associated inhibitory factors inhibit cellular and axonal regeneration resulting in 
      permanent disability. Three of these factors (Nogo-A, oligodendrocyte myelin 
      glycoprotein, myelin-associated glycoprotein) bind to a common receptor: the Nogo-66 
      receptor (NgR1). NgR1 is expressed mainly on neurons and is usually associated in a 
      trimolecular complex. The second member of the complex, LINGO-1, is often connected 
      to NgR1 function and is further found to function independently as a negative 
      regulator of oligodendrocyte proliferation and differentiation. The third member of 
      the NgR complex is either the p75 neurotrophin receptor, TROY, or an as yet 
      unidentified co-receptor. Targeting of factors contained in this complex has been 
      described to lead to the promotion of neurite outgrowth, oligodendrocyte 
      proliferation and differentiation and inhibition of cell death. In the current 
      review, we aim to describe the mechanisms of action of the chemical and biological 
      compounds used in targeting NgR1 and LINGO-1. This will be achieved using three 
      examples: blocking of ligand binding to NgR1 in treatment of spinal cord injury, 
      antibody-mediated inhibition of LINGO-1 to promote oligodendrocyte differentiation 
      in multiple sclerosis, and the use of soluble NgR1 to sequester Abeta peptide in the 
      periphery in Alzheimer's disease.

AB  - In recent years, a particular interest has focused on the accumulation of fatty 
      acids with very long chains (VLCFA) in the occurrence of neurodegenerative diseases 
      such as Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis or dementia. Indeed, it seems 
      increasingly clear that this accumulation of VLCFA in the central nervous system is 
      accompanied by a progressive demyelination resulting in death of neuronal cells. 
      Nevertheless, molecular mechanisms by which VLCFA result in toxicity remain unclear. 
      This study highlights for the first time in 3 different cellular models 
      (oligodendrocytes 158 N, primary mouse brain culture, and patient fibroblasts) the 
      types of cell death involved where VLCFA-induced ROS production leads to autophagy. 
      The autophagic process protects the cell from this VLCFA-induced toxicity. Thus, 
      autophagy in addition to oxidative stress can offer new therapeutic approaches.

AB  - The cerebellum is the part of the brain most involved in controlling motor and 
      cognitive function. The surface becomes convoluted, forming folia that have a 
      characteristic internal structure of three layers including molecular, Purkinje 
      cell, and granular layer. This complex neural network gives rise to a massive 
      signal-processing capability. Cholesterol is a major constituent, derived by de novo 
      synthesis and the blood-brain barrier. Cholesterol is tightly regulated between 
      neurons and glia-that is, astrocytes, microglia, and oligodendrocytes-and is 
      essential for normal brain development. The axon is wrapped by myelin (cholesterol, 
      phospholipids, and glycosphingolipids) and made up of membranes of oligodendrocytes, 
      separated by periodic gaps in the myelin sheath, called nodes of Ranvier. 
      Hypercholesterolemia is associated with increased oxidative stress and the 
      development of neurotoxicity and Alzheimer's disease. Treatment with natural 
      products has been found to support improved brain function and reduce 
      low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol level. Fish oil is one such product; among the 
      many plant products are: Morus alba leaves, fruit, and bark; pomegranate fruit and 
      peel; Barley β - glucans; date palm; and Allium sativum. The therapeutic potential 
      was discussed in relation with the antilipidemic drugs, statins (HMG-CoA reductase 
      inhibitors).

TI  - Neuronal apoptosis does not correlate with dementia in HIV infection but is related 
      to microglial activation and axonal damage.
PG  - 123-33
AB  - To characterize the distribution of apoptotic neurons and their relationships with 
      the stage of disease, a history of HIV-dementia, and the degree of productive HIV 
      infection, microglial activation and axonal damage, we examined the brains of 40 
      patients. Samples of frontal and temporal cortex, basal ganglia and brain stem were 
      taken post-mortem from 20 patients with AIDS (including three with HIV-dementia, and 
      eight with cognitive disorders that did not fulfil the criteria for HIV-dementia), 
      10 HIV-positive asymptomatic cases and 10 seronegative controls. Neuronal apoptosis 
      was demonstrated by in situ end labelling in 18 AIDS cases and two pre-AIDS cases; a 
      single apoptotic neuron was present in the temporal cortex of a control. 
      Semiquantitative evaluation showed that the severity of neuronal apoptosis in the 
      cerebral cortex correlated with the presence of cerebral atrophy, but not with a 
      history of HIV dementia. There was no global quantitative correlation between 
      neuronal apoptosis and HIV encephalitis or microglial activation. However, there was 
      some topographical correlation between these changes. In the basal ganglia, 
      apoptotic neurons were much more abundant in the vicinity of multinucleated giant 
      cells and/or p24 expressing cells. Microglial activation was constantly present in 
      these areas. Axonal damage was identified using beta-amyloid-precursor protein 
      (betaAPP) immunostaining in 17 AIDS and eight pre-AIDS brains. Although no global 
      quantitative correlation could be established between axonal damage and neuronal 
      apoptosis there was an obvious topographic correlation supporting the view that 
      axonal damage, either secondary to local microglial activation or due to the 
      intervention of systemic factors, may also contribute to neuronal apoptosis.

PG  - 6873-6882
LID - 10.1007/s12035-019-1579-1 [doi]
AB  - White matter (WM) abnormalities are a well-established feature of Huntington disease 
      (HD), although their nature is not fully understood. Here, we asked whether 
      remyelination as a measure of WM plasticity is impaired in a model of HD. Using the 
      cuprizone assay, we examined demyelination and remyelination responses in YAC128 HD 
      mice. Treatment with 0.2% cuprizone (CPZ) for 6 weeks resulted in significant 
      reduction in mature (GSTπ-positive) oligodendrocyte counts and FluoroMyelin staining 
      in the corpus callosum, leading to similar demyelination states in YAC128 and 
      wild-type (WT) mice. Six weeks following cessation of CPZ, we observed robust 
      remyelination in WT mice as indicated by an increase in mature oligodendrocyte 
      counts and FluoroMyelin staining. In contrast, YAC128 mice exhibited an impaired 
      remyelination response. The increase in mature oligodendrocyte counts in YAC128 HD 
      mice following CPZ cessation was lower than that of WT. Furthermore, there was no 
      increase in FluoroMyelin staining compared to the demyelinated state in YAC128 mice. 
      We confirmed these findings using electron microscopy where the CPZ-induced 
      reduction in myelinated axons was reversed following CPZ cessation in WT but not 
      YAC128 mice. Our findings demonstrate that remyelination is impaired in YAC128 mice 
      and suggest that WM plasticity may be compromised in HD.

AB  - The diagnosis of degenerative dementias heavily relies on the identification of 
      neuronal or glial inclusions. Tauopathy is probably the largest group including 
      Alzheimer and Pick disease, mutation of the tau gene, progressive supranuclear 
      palsy, corticobasal degeneration, and argyrophilic grain disease. Lewy bodies, when 
      numerous in the cerebral cortex, are usually associated with the cognitive deficit 
      of Parkinson disease dementia or of dementia with Lewy bodies--both conditions being 
      distinguished by clinical information. The inclusions of the dentate gyrus, only 
      labeled by anti-ubiquitin antibodies, isolate a subgroup of fronto-temporal dementia 
      (FTDu), sometimes familial and sometimes associated with amyotrophic lateral 
      sclerosis. Mutations of the progranulin gene have been recently discovered among a 
      significant proportion of these patients. Neuronal Intermediate Filament Inclusion 
      Disease (NIFID) is a rare, apparently sporadic dementia, characterized by the 
      presence of large inclusions in the cell body of many neurons. These inclusions 
      react with antibodies directed against neurofilaments or against other intermediate 
      filaments (such as alpha-internexin). The diagnostic value of some of these 
      inclusions allowing the classification of the degenerative dementias has been 
      discussed. The link between the inclusions and the pathogenetic mechanism is indeed 
      probably variable. It should however be stressed that whenever their composition has 
      been elucidated, the inclusions have given important clues to the pathogenesis of 
      the disease in which they had been found.

TI  - Opiate drug use and the pathophysiology of neuroAIDS.
PG  - 435-52
AB  - Opiate abuse and HIV-1 have been described as interrelated epidemics, and even in 
      the advent of combined anti-retroviral therapy, the additional abuse of opiates 
      appears to result in greater neurologic and cognitive deficits. The central nervous 
      system (CNS) is particularly vulnerable to interactive opiate-HIV-1 effects, in part 
      because of the unique responses of microglia and astroglia. Although neurons are 
      principally responsible for behavior and cognition, HIV-1 infection and replication 
      in the brain is largely limited to microglia, while astroglia and perhaps glial 
      progenitors can be latently infected. Thus, neuronal dysfunction and injury result 
      from cellular and viral toxins originating from HIV-1 infected/exposed glia. 
      Importantly, subsets of glial cells including oligodendrocytes, as well as neurons, 
      express µ-opioid receptors and therefore can be direct targets for heroin and 
      morphine (the major metabolite of heroin in the CNS), which preferentially activate 
      µ-opioid receptors. This review highlights findings that neuroAIDS is a glially 
      driven disease, and that opiate abuse may act at multiple glial-cell types to 
      further compromise neuron function and survival. The ongoing, reactive cross-talk 
      between opiate drug and HIV-1 co-exposed microglia and astroglia appears to 
      exacerbate critical proinflammatory and excitotoxic events leading to neuron 
      dysfunction, injury, and potentially death. Opiates enhance synaptodendritic damage 
      and a loss of synaptic connectivity, which is viewed as the substrate of cognitive 
      deficits. We especially emphasize that opioid signaling and interactions with HIV-1 
      are contextual, differing among cell types, and even within subsets of the same cell 
      type. For example, astroglia even within a single brain region are heterogeneous in 
      their expression of µ-, δ-, and κ-opioid receptors, as well as CXCR4 and CCR5, and 
      Toll-like receptors. Thus, defining the distinct targets engaged by opiates in each 
      cell type, and among brain regions, is critical to an understanding of how opiate 
      abuse exacerbates neuroAIDS.

TI  - Glial levels determine severity of white matter disease in Alzheimer's disease: a 
      neuropathological study of glial changes.
PG  - 159-69
AB  - The morphological components of cerebral white matter disease (WMD) were studied in 
      17 cases of clinically diagnosed dementia and neuropathologically verified 
      Alzheimer's disease (AD) with concomitant WMD. The distribution of grey and white 
      matter changes was evaluated and overall as well as regional severity was graded. 
      Total glial numbers in frontal white matter were counted using a light microscope. 
      Oligodendrocyte and astrocyte quantities as well as astrocytic reactivity were 
      assessed from frontal and parietal lobe white matter using a computer assisted 
      morphometric method. The AD-WMD group was compared with 10 nondemented age-matched 
      controls. Astrocyte/oligodendrocyte ratio (AOR) was calculated, total glial counts 
      and AOR were compared with severity of WMD, and Alzheimer encephalopathy grade was 
      subjectively assessed. Astrocytic numbers, AOR and astrocytic reactivity proved to 
      be significantly higher in the demented group, whereas oligodendrocytic and total 
      glial counts were significantly lower. Furthermore, AOR proved to be positively 
      correlated with severity of WMD, whereas no association was found with Alzheimer 
      encephalopathy. We conclude that WMD in dementia, for example, of the type seen in 
      AD, can easily be detected, measured and graded quantitatively, with AOR being a 
      significant indicator of the severity of changes. This could serve as a tool for 
      differentiating white matter pathologies in dementia and may be the basis for 
      recognition of the mildest white matter changes with new imaging methods, and enable 
      potential clinical intervention.

TI  - The neurobiology of APOE in schizophrenia and mood disorders.
PG  - 962-79
AB  - APOE is a major component of several lipoproteins. In addition to its role as a 
      lipid transport protein APOE also serves a dual role as a glial derived, synaptic 
      signalling molecule and thought to play an important role in synaptic plasticity and 
      cognition. Polymorphisms within the APOE gene have been associated with the 
      incidence of Alzheimer's disease. In light of the similarities in the cognitive 
      deficits experienced in both Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia as well as the 
      comorbidity of depression in Alzheimer's disease, aberrant APOE signalling has been 
      implicated in the pathologies of schizophrenia and mood disorders. The schizophrenia 
      candidate gene, reelin, also shares common receptors with APOE, further supporting a 
      role for APOE in the pathology of these disorders. This review will summarise the 
      current understanding of the involvement of APOE and its receptors in the 
      symptomatology and pathology of schizophrenia and mood disorders and the 
      implications of this involvement for drug treatment.

TI  - Myelin content changes in probable Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive 
      impairment: Associations with age and severity of neuropsychiatric impairment.
PG  - 1359-1372
LID - 10.1002/jmri.25849 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Existing indices of white matter integrity such as fractional anisotropy 
      and magnetization transfer ratio may not provide optimal specificity to myelin 
      content. In contrast, myelin water fraction (MWF) derived from the multiecho T(2) 
      relaxation time technique may serve as a more direct measure of myelin content. 
      PURPOSE/HYPOTHESIS: The goal of the present study was to identify markers of 
      regional demyelination in patients with probable Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild 
      cognitive impairment (MCI) in relation to age and severity of neuropsychiatric 
      impairment. POPULATION: The sample included patients diagnosed with probable AD (n = 
      25) or MCI (n = 43), and cognitively intact elderly controls (n = 33). FIELD 
      STRENGTH/SEQUENCE ASSESSMENT: Long T(2) , short T(2) , and MWF values were measured 
      with a 1.5T scanner in periventricular and deep normal-appearing white matter 
      (NAWM), serving as indices of intra/extracellular water content and myelin content. 
      A comprehensive neuropsychological and neuropsychiatric assessment was administered 
      to all participants. STATISTICAL TESTS, RESULTS: AD patients displayed higher 
      age-adjusted long and short T(2) values and reduced MWF values in left 
      temporal/parietal and bilateral periventricular NAWM than controls and MCI patients 
      (P < 0.004; one-way analysis of covariance [ANCOVA] tests). Short T(2) /MWF values 
      in temporal, frontal, and periventricular NAWM of controls and/or MCI patients were 
      significantly associated with episodic and semantic memory performance and 
      depressive symptomatology (P < 0.004; partial correlation indices). The impact of 
      age on memory performance was significantly (P < 0.01; mediated linear regression 
      analyses) mediated by age-related changes in short T(2) and MWF values in these 
      regions. DATA CONCLUSION: Age-related demyelination is associated with memory 
      impairment (especially in prodromal dementia states) and symptoms of depression in 
      an anatomically specific manner. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 1 Technical Efficacy: Stage 3 J.

TI  - Neuropathologic changes of multiple system atrophy and diffuse Lewy body disease.
PG  - 210-6
LID - 10.1055/s-0034-1381732 [doi]
AB  - The accumulation of fibrillar α-synuclein protein is the pathological hallmark 
      occurring in both multiple system atrophy (MSA) and diffuse Lewy body disease 
      (DLBD). The oligodendrocytes are especially involved in MSA, while subtypes of 
      neurons are the targets in DLBD. In both instances, the changes are widespread 
      within the central nervous system, but with distinct and topistic vulnerability.Two 
      diagnostic subtypes of MSA are currently applied: multiple system atrophy-cerebellar 
      (MSA-C), formerly designated olivopontocerebellar atrophy, and multiple system 
      atrophy-parkinsonian (MSA-P), formerly called striatonigral degeneration. However, 
      overlaps exist between them, notably during the late stages of the illness. The 
      brainstem and cerebellum are especially vulnerable and dysfunctional in MSA-C, but 
      the striatum and mesencephalon in MSA-P, wherein parkinsonism usually prevails.In 
      DLBD, Lewy-body-containing neurons (LBCN) involve the cerebral cortex in addition to 
      the sites affected in Parkinson disease (PD). Thus, dementia and parkinsonism occur, 
      often without brain atrophy. Then, two main pathological subtypes are used: the 
      limbic or the cortical type. Possibly, DLBD, either the limbic or cortical-type, is 
      the ultimate stage of PD, which corresponds to the brainstem type. The epidemiologic 
      and genetic traits causing sporadic MSA and sporadic DLBD are not known.

TI  - Unifying hypothesis for the pathogenesis of HIV-associated dementia complex, 
      vacuolar myelopathy, and sensory neuropathy.
PG  - 379-88
AB  - Neurological diseases associated with HIV infection include dementia, vacuolar 
      myelopathy, and sensory neuropathy. Although in vitro studies suggest that other 
      nervous system cell types could harbor HIV, immunohistochemical and in situ 
      hybridization studies have indicated that only macrophages/microglia are 
      significantly infected in the central nervous system. In the peripheral nervous 
      system, even HIV-infected macrophages are rare. Therefore, theories regarding the 
      pathogenesis of HIV-associated neurologic disorders have centered around the 
      elaboration of substances that may be toxic to neurons, oligodendrocytes or myelin. 
      These potential toxins include HIV proteins, cellular metabolites, and cytokines. In 
      this review we present evidence that there are large numbers of 
      macrophages/microglia present in the nervous system of patients with these diseases 
      and that they produce tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha. The large increase in 
      macrophage activity late in HIV infection may be due to the diminution in production 
      by CD4-positive T cells of cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-10 which are 
      inhibitors of macrophage activities. We hypothesize that HIV-associated dementia 
      complex, vacuolar myelopathy, and sensory neuropathy are directly or indirectly 
      related to the increased numbers of macrophages found in brain, spinal cord, and 
      peripheral nerve. Future therapies may be directed towards inhibition of macrophage 
      functions.

TI  - Argyrophilic grain disease: a late-onset dementia with distinctive features among 
      tauopathies.
PG  - 269-83
AB  - Argyrophilic grain disease (AgD) is a late-onset dementia morphologically 
      characterized by the presence of abundant spindle-shaped argyrophilic grains (ArG) 
      in neuronal processes and coiled bodies in oligodendrocytes. AgD changes consist of 
      the microtubule-associated protein tau in an abnormally and hyperphosphorylated 
      state and are mainly found in limbic regions, for example, in the hippocampus, the 
      entorhinal and transentorhinal cortices and the amygdala. AgD shows a significant 
      correlation with advancing age, and it became apparent from recent 
      clinicopathological studies that it might account for approximately 5% of all 
      dementia cases. Further immunohistochemical and biochemical studies revealed that 
      AgD is a four-repeat (4R) tauopathy similar to PSP and corticobasal degeneration 
      (CBD), but distinct from Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Pick's disease. Moreover, a 
      common genetic background regarding the tau gene haplotype has been suggested for 
      AgD, PSP and CBD. However, although there are currently only limited data available, 
      AgD seems to be clinically distinct from PSP and CBD and shares rather features of 
      (mild) AD or other forms of 'limbic' dementias, among them senile dementia with 
      tangles and the localized form of AD.

TI  - Myelin Detection Using Rapid Quantitative MR Imaging Correlated to Macroscopically 
      Registered Luxol Fast Blue-Stained Brain Specimens.
PG  - 1096-1102
LID - 10.3174/ajnr.A5168 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Myelin detection is of great value in monitoring diseases 
      such as multiple sclerosis and dementia. However, most MR imaging methods to measure 
      myelin are challenging for routine clinical use. Recently, a novel method was 
      published, in which the presence of myelin is inferred by using its effect on the 
      intra- and extracellular water relaxation rates and proton density, observable by 
      rapid quantitative MR imaging. The purpose of this work was to validate this method 
      further on the brains of 12 fresh, intact cadavers. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The 12 
      brains were scanned with a quantification sequence to determine the longitudinal and 
      transverse relaxation rates and proton density as input for the myelin estimations. 
      Subsequently, the brains were excised at postmortem examination, and brain slices 
      were stained with Luxol fast blue to verify the presence of myelin. The optical 
      density values of photographs of the stained brain slices were registered with the 
      MR images and correlated with the myelin estimation performed by quantitative MR 
      imaging. RESULTS: A correlation was found between the 2 methods with a mean Spearman 
      ρ for all subjects of 0.74 ± 0.11. Linear regression showed a mean intercept of 
      1.50% ± 2.84% and a mean slope of 4.37% ± 1.73%/%. A lower correlation was found for 
      the separate longitudinal relaxation rates and proton density (ρ = 0.63 ± 0.12 and 
      -0.73 ± 0.09, respectively). For transverse relaxation rates, the ρ was very low 
      (0.11 ± 0.28). CONCLUSIONS: The observed correlation supports the validity of myelin 
      measurement by using the MR imaging quantification method.

TI  - Neuronal and glial calcium signaling in Alzheimer's disease.
PG  - 385-97
AB  - Cognitive impairment and emotional disturbances in Alzheimer's disease (AD) result 
      from the degeneration of synapses and death of neurons in the limbic system and 
      associated regions of the cerebral cortex. An alteration in the proteolytic 
      processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) results in increased production 
      and accumulation of amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta) in the brain. Abeta has been shown 
      to cause synaptic dysfunction and can render neurons vulnerable to excitotoxicity 
      and apoptosis by a mechanism involving disruption of cellular calcium homeostasis. 
      By inducing membrane lipid peroxidation and generation of the aldehyde 
      4-hydroxynonenal, Abeta impairs the function of membrane ion-motive ATPases and 
      glucose and glutamate transporters, and can enhance calcium influx through 
      voltage-dependent and ligand-gated calcium channels. Reduced levels of a secreted 
      form of APP which normally regulates synaptic plasticity and cell survival may also 
      promote disruption of synaptic calcium homeostasis in AD. Some cases of inherited AD 
      are caused by mutations in presenilins 1 and 2 which perturb endoplasmic reticulum 
      (ER) calcium homeostasis such that greater amounts of calcium are released upon 
      stimulation, possibly as the result of alterations in IP(3) and ryanodine receptor 
      channels, Ca(2+)-ATPases and the ER stress protein Herp. Abnormalities in calcium 
      regulation in astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and microglia have also been documented 
      in studies of experimental models of AD, suggesting contributions of these 
      alterations to neuronal dysfunction and cell death in AD. Collectively, the 
      available data show that perturbed cellular calcium homeostasis plays a prominent 
      role in the pathogenesis of AD, suggesting potential benefits of preventative and 
      therapeutic strategies that stabilize cellular calcium homeostasis.

AB  - Drug repurposing is an efficient approach in new treatment development since it 
      leverages previous work from one disease to another. While multiple sclerosis (MS), 
      Parkinson's disease (PD), and Alzheimer's disease (AD) are all neurodegenerative 
      diseases of the central nervous system (CNS) and differ in many clinical and 
      pathological aspects, it is possible that they may share some mechanistic features. 
      We hypothesized that focusing on gene expression in a CNS cell type specific manner 
      might uncover similarities between diseases that could be missed using whole tissue 
      gene expression analyses. We found similarities and differences in gene expression 
      in these three distinct diseases, depending upon cell type. Microglia genes were 
      increased in all three diseases, and gene expression levels were correlated strongly 
      among these three neurodegenerative diseases. In astrocytes and endothelia, 
      upregulation and correlations were observed only between MS and PD, but not AD. 
      Neuronal genes were down-regulated in all three diseases, but correlations of 
      changes of individual genes between diseases were not strong. Oligodendrocyte showed 
      gene expression changes that were not shared among the three diseases. Together 
      these data suggest that treatments targeting microglia are most amenable to drug 
      repurposing in MS, PD, and AD, while treatments targeting other CNS cells must be 
      tailored to each disease.

TI  - Decreased myelin lipids in Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia.
PG  - 319-23
AB  - The lipid composition of white matter and myelin from the semioval centre was 
      studied in autopsy material from cases with Alzheimer's disease (AD) (n = 11), 
      vascular dementia (VD) (n = 7), and age-matched controls (n = 11). In AD and VD the 
      white matter content of phospholipids and cholesterol was reduced to 72-76% of the 
      control values (P less than 0.01), the diminution of cerebrosides and sulphatides 
      was more pronounced (55-69%) (P less than 0.001) while the concentration of 
      gangliosides did not change significantly (87-90%). The myelin composition was the 
      same in the 3 groups, suggesting that the white matter involvement is not caused by 
      alteration of the myelin structure. The altered lipid composition in white matter in 
      AD and VD suggests that the myelin sheath is the primary lesion site.

TI  - Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, gene deregulation in the anterior horn of the spinal 
      cord and frontal cortex area 8: implications in frontotemporal lobar degeneration.
PG  - 823-851
LID - 10.18632/aging.101195 [doi]
AB  - Transcriptome arrays identifies 747 genes differentially expressed in the anterior 
      horn of the spinal cord and 2,300 genes differentially expressed in frontal cortex 
      area 8 in a single group of typical sALS cases without frontotemporal dementia 
      compared with age-matched controls. Main up-regulated clusters in the anterior horn 
      are related to inflammation and apoptosis; down-regulated clusters are linked to 
      axoneme structures and protein synthesis. In contrast, up-regulated gene clusters in 
      frontal cortex area 8 involve neurotransmission, synaptic proteins and vesicle 
      trafficking, whereas main down-regulated genes cluster into oligodendrocyte function 
      and myelin-related proteins. RT-qPCR validates the expression of 58 of 66 assessed 
      genes from different clusters. The present results: a. reveal regional differences 
      in de-regulated gene expression between the anterior horn of the spinal cord and 
      frontal cortex area 8 in the same individuals suffering from sALS; b. validate and 
      extend our knowledge about the complexity of the inflammatory response in the 
      anterior horn of the spinal cord; and c. identify for the first time extensive gene 
      up-regulation of neurotransmission and synaptic-related genes, together with 
      significant down-regulation of oligodendrocyte- and myelin-related genes, as 
      important contributors to the pathogenesis of frontal cortex alterations in the 
      sALS/frontotemporal lobar degeneration spectrum complex at stages with no apparent 
      cognitive impairment.

TI  - Assessing white matter ischemic damage in dementia patients by measurement of myelin 
      proteins.
PG  - 1050-7
LID - 10.1038/jcbfm.2013.46 [doi]
AB  - White matter ischemia is difficult to quantify histologically. Myelin-associated 
      glycoprotein (MAG) is highly susceptible to ischemia, being expressed only 
      adaxonally, far from the oligodendrocyte cell body. Myelin-basic protein (MBP) and 
      proteolipid protein (PLP) are expressed throughout the myelin sheath. We compared 
      MAG, MBP, and PLP levels in parietal white matter homogenates from 17 vascular 
      dementia (VaD), 49 Alzheimer's disease (AD), and 33 control brains, after assessing 
      the post-mortem stability of these proteins. Small vessel disease (SVD) and cerebral 
      amyloid angiopathy (CAA) severity had been assessed in paraffin sections. The 
      concentration of MAG remained stable post-mortem, declined with increasing SVD, and 
      was significantly lower in VaD than controls. The concentration of MBP fell 
      progressively post-mortem, limiting its diagnostic utility in this context. 
      Proteolipid protein was stable post-mortem and increased significantly with SVD 
      severity. The MAG/PLP ratio declined significantly with SVD and CAA severity. The 
      MAG and PLP levels and MAG/PLP did not differ significantly between AD and control 
      brains. We validated the utility of MAG and MAG/PLP measurements on analysis of 74 
      frontal white matter samples from an Oxford cohort in which SVD had previously been 
      scored. MAG concentration and the MAG/PLP ratio are useful post-mortem measures of 
      ante-mortem white matter ischemia.

TI  - The solubility of alpha-synuclein in multiple system atrophy differs from that of 
      dementia with Lewy bodies and Parkinson's disease.
PG  - 87-96
AB  - Intracellular inclusions containing alpha-synuclein (alpha SN) are pathognomonic 
      features of several neurodegenerative disorders. Inclusions occur in 
      oligodendrocytes in multiple system atrophy (MSA) and in neurons in dementia with 
      Lewy bodies (DLB) and Parkinson's disease (PD). In order to identify 
      disease-associated changes of alpha SN, this study compared the levels, solubility 
      and molecular weight species of alpha SN in brain homogenates from MSA, DLB, PD and 
      normal aged controls. In DLB and PD, substantial amounts of detergent-soluble and 
      detergent-insoluble alpha SN were detected compared with controls in grey matter 
      homogenate. Compared with controls, MSA cases had significantly higher levels of 
      alpha SN in the detergent-soluble fraction of brain samples from pons and white 
      matter but detergent-insoluble alpha SN was not detected. There was an inverse 
      correlation between buffered saline-soluble and detergent-soluble levels of alpha SN 
      in individual MSA cases suggesting a transition towards insolubility in disease. The 
      differences in solubility of alpha SN between grey and white matter in disease may 
      result from different processing of alpha SN in neurons compared with 
      oligodendrocytes. Highly insoluble alpha SN is not involved in the pathogenesis of 
      MSA. It is therefore possible that buffered saline-soluble or detergent-soluble 
      forms of alpha SN are involved in the pathogenesis of other alpha SN-related 
      diseases.

AB  - This chapter will discuss two of the most widely used approaches to assessing brain 
      structure: neuroimaging and neuropathology. Whereas neuropathologic approaches to 
      studying the central nervous system have been utilized for many decades and have 
      provided insights into morphologic correlates of dementia for over 100 years, 
      accurate structural imaging techniques "blossomed" with the development and 
      refinement of computerized tomographic scanning and magnetic resonance imaging 
      (MRI), beginning in the late 1970s. As Alzheimer disease progresses over time, there 
      is progressive atrophy of the hippocampus and neocortex--this can be quantified and 
      regional accentuation of the atrophy can be evaluated using quantitative MRI 
      scanning. Furthermore, ligands for amyloid proteins have recently been 
      developed--these can be used in positron emission tomography studies to localize 
      amyloid proteins, and (in theory) study the dynamics of their deposition (and 
      clearance) within the brain over time. Neuropathologic studies of the brain, using 
      highly specific antibodies, can demonstrate synapse loss and the deposition of 
      proteins important in AD progression--specifically ABeta and phosphor-tau. Finally, 
      neuropathologic assessment of (autopsy) brain specimens can provide important 
      correlation with sophisticated neuroimaging techniques.

AB  - Myelin abnormalities that reflect damage to developing and mature brains are often 
      found in neurological diseases with evidence of inflammatory infiltration and 
      microglial activation. Many cytokines are virtually undetectable in the uninflamed 
      central nervous system (CNS), so that their rapid induction and sustained elevation 
      in immune and glial cells contributes to dysregulation of the inflammatory response 
      and neural cell homeostasis. This results in aberrant neural cell development, 
      cytotoxicity, and loss of the primary myelin-producing cells of the CNS, the 
      oligodendrocytes. This article provides an overview of cytokine and chemokine 
      activity in the CNS with relevance to clinical conditions of neonatal and adult 
      demyelinating disease, brain trauma, and mental disorders with observed white matter 
      defects. Experimental models that mimic human disease have been developed in order 
      to study pathogenic and therapeutic mechanisms, but have shown mixed success in 
      clinical application. However, genetically altered animals, and models of CNS 
      inflammation and demyelination, have offered great insight into the complexities of 
      neuroimmune interactions that impact oligodendrocyte function. The intracellular 
      signaling pathways of selected cytokines have also been highlighted to illustrate 
      current knowledge of receptor-mediated events. By learning to interpret the actions 
      of cytokines and by improving methods to target appropriate predictors of disease 
      risk selectively, a more comprehensive understanding of altered immunoregulation 
      will aid in the development of advanced treatment options for patients with 
      inflammatory white matter disorders.

AB  - This study aims to statistically describe histologically stained white matter brain 
      sections to subsequently inform and validate diffusion MRI techniques. For the first 
      time, we characterise volume fraction distributions of three of the main structures 
      in deep subcortical white matter (axons, astrocytes, and myelinated axons) in a 
      representative cohort of an ageing population for which well-characterized 
      neuropathology data is available. We analysed a set of samples from 90 subjects of 
      the Cognitive Function and Ageing Study (CFAS), stratified into three groups of 30 
      subjects each, in relation to the presence of age-associated deep subcortical 
      lesions. This provides volume fraction distributions in different scenarios relevant 
      to brain diffusion MRI in dementia. We also assess statistically significant 
      differences found between these groups. In agreement with previous literature, our 
      results indicate that white matter lesions are related with a decrease in the 
      myelinated axons fraction and an increase in astrocytic fraction, while no 
      statistically significant changes occur in axonal mean fraction. In addition, we 
      introduced a framework to quantify volume fraction distributions from 2D 
      immunohistochemistry images, which is validated against in silico simulations. Since 
      a trade-off between precision and resolution emerged, we also performed an 
      assessment of the optimal scale for computing such distributions.

TI  - Apolipoprotein E affects both myelin breakdown and cognition: implications for 
      age-related trajectories of decline into dementia.
PG  - 1380-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Age-related myelin breakdown is most evident in later-myelinating white 
      matter (LMwm) brain regions. This process might degrade cognitive processing speed 
      (CPS) underlying age-related cognitive decline and the predominance of age as a risk 
      factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) 4 allele is the second 
      most important AD risk factor. We tested the hypothesis that ApoE4 accelerates 
      age-related slowing in CPS through the process of myelin breakdown. METHODS: 
      Calculated transverse relaxation rates (R(2)), an indirect magnetic resonance 
      imaging measure of myelin breakdown in LMwm, and measures of CPS were obtained in 22 
      ApoE4+ and 80 ApoE4-, healthy "younger-old" individuals. To assess specificity, 
      contrasting early-myelinating white matter region and memory task were also 
      examined. RESULTS: The CPS versus LMwm R(2) remained significant in the ApoE4+ group 
      even after age was statistically adjusted (r = .65, p = .001) and differed from the 
      correlation observed in the ApoE4- group (Fisher's z test = 3.22, p < .002). No 
      significant associations were observed with the contrast region and memory task in 
      either ApoE subgroup. CONCLUSIONS: A specific association between CPS and myelin 
      breakdown in LMwm exists in asymptomatic "younger-old" individuals at increased 
      genetic risk for AD. Although inferences of change over time and causality are 
      limited by the cross-sectional study design, this finding lends support to the 
      hypotheses that myelin breakdown underlies age-related slowing in CPS and that by 
      altering the trajectory of myelin breakdown, ApoE alleles shift the age at onset of 
      cognitive decline. Combined use of biomarkers and CPS measures might be useful in 
      developing and targeting primary prevention treatments for AD.

TI  - Thrombin and prothrombin are expressed by neurons and glial cells and accumulate in 
      neurofibrillary tangles in Alzheimer disease brain.
PG  - 19-25
AB  - Thrombin is a serine protease that is generated by proteolytic cleavage of its 
      precursor, prothrombin. We previously showed that thrombin proteolyses the 
      microtubule-associated protein tau and that phosphorylation of tau inhibits this 
      process. To characterize further the role of thrombin in the brain, we investigated 
      prothrombin and thrombin expression in cultured brain cells and in brains of 
      control, Alzheimer disease (AD) and parkinsonism-dementia complex of Guam (PDCG). We 
      show by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction that prothrombin mRNA is 
      expressed in brain tissues, neuroblastoma cells, and cultured human astrocytes, 
      oligodendrocytes, and microglial cells. We also show by immunohistochemistry that 
      the proteins prothrombin and thrombin are present in brain using specific monoclonal 
      and polyclonal antibodies for both proteins. All antibodies stained residual serum 
      in blood vessels, as well as normal pyramidal neurons and their processes, and some 
      astrocytes. Additionally, in AD and PDCG cases, all antibodies stained extra- and 
      intracellular neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), senile plaques, and reactive 
      microglial cells. The ubiquitous expression of prothrombin and thrombin in brain 
      cells suggests that thrombin plays an important physiological role in normal brain. 
      The accumulation of thrombin and prothrombin in NFTs supports the hypothesis that 
      thrombin may be involved in tau proteolysis and that failure to metabolize tau may 
      lead to its aggregation in neurodegenerative diseases.

TI  - Age-related myelin breakdown: a developmental model of cognitive decline and 
      Alzheimer's disease.
PG  - 5-18; author reply 49-62
AB  - A hypothetical model of Alzheimer's disease (AD) as a uniquely human brain disorder 
      rooted in its exceptional process of myelination is presented. Cortical regions with 
      the most protracted development are most vulnerable to AD pathology, and this 
      protracted development is driven by oligodendrocytes, which continue to 
      differentiate into myelin producing cells late into the fifth decade of life. The 
      unique metabolic demands of producing and maintaining their vast myelin sheaths and 
      synthesizing the brain's cholesterol supply make oligodendrocytes especially 
      susceptible to a variety of insults. Their vulnerability increases with increasing 
      age at differentiation as later-differentiating cells myelinate increasing numbers 
      of axonal segments. These vulnerable late-differentiating cells drive the protracted 
      process of intracortical myelination and by increasing local cholesterol and iron 
      levels, progressively increase the toxicity of the intracortical environment forming 
      the basis for the age risk factor for AD. At older ages, the roughly bilaterally 
      symmetrical continuum of oligodendrocyte vulnerability manifests as a progressive 
      pattern of myelin breakdown that recapitulates the developmental process of 
      myelination in reverse. The ensuing homeostatic responses to myelin breakdown 
      further increase intracortical toxicity and results in the relentless progression 
      and non-random anatomical distribution of AD lesions that eventually cause neuronal 
      dysfunction and degeneration. This process causes a slowly progressive disruption of 
      neural impulse transmission that degrades the temporal synchrony of widely 
      distributed neural networks underlying normal brain function. The resulting network 
      "disconnections" first impact functions that are most dependent on large-scale 
      synchronization including higher cognitive functions and formation of new memories. 
      Multiple genetic and environmental risk factors (e.g. amyloid beta-peptide and free 
      radical toxicity, head trauma, anoxia, cholesterol levels, etc.) can contribute to 
      the cognitive deficits observed in aging and AD through their impact on the 
      life-long trajectory of myelin development and breakdown. This 
      development-to-degeneration model is testable through imaging and post mortem 
      methods and highlights the vital role of myelin in impulse transmission and 
      synchronous brain function. The model offers a framework that explains the 
      anatomical distribution and progressive course of AD pathology, some of the failures 
      of promising therapeutic interventions, and suggests further testable hypotheses as 
      well as novel approaches for intervention efforts.

TI  - Toll-like receptors in health and disease in the brain: mechanisms and therapeutic 
      potential.
PG  - 367-87
LID - 10.1042/CS20110164 [doi]
AB  - The discovery of mammalian TLRs (Toll-like receptors), first identified in 1997 
      based on their homology with Drosophila Toll, greatly altered our understanding of 
      how the innate immune system recognizes and responds to diverse microbial pathogens. 
      TLRs are evolutionarily conserved type I transmembrane proteins expressed in both 
      immune and non-immune cells, and are typified by N-terminal leucine-rich repeats and 
      a highly conserved C-terminal domain termed the TIR [Toll/interleukin (IL)-1 
      receptor] domain. Upon stimulation with their cognate ligands, TLR signalling 
      elicits the production of cytokines, enzymes and other inflammatory mediators that 
      can have an impact on several aspects of CNS (central nervous system) homoeostasis 
      and pathology. For example, TLR signalling plays a crucial role in initiating host 
      defence responses during CNS microbial infection. Furthermore, TLRs are targets for 
      many adjuvants which help shape pathogen-specific adaptive immune responses in 
      addition to triggering innate immunity. Our knowledge of TLR expression and function 
      in the CNS has greatly expanded over the last decade, with new data revealing that 
      TLRs also have an impact on non-infectious CNS diseases/injury. In particular, TLRs 
      recognize a number of endogenous molecules liberated from damaged tissues and, as 
      such, influence inflammatory responses during tissue injury and autoimmunity. In 
      addition, recent studies have implicated TLR involvement during neurogenesis, and 
      learning and memory in the absence of any underlying infectious aetiology. Owing to 
      their presence and immune-regulatory role within the brain, TLRs represent an 
      attractive therapeutic target for numerous CNS disorders and infectious diseases. 
      However, it is clear that TLRs can exert either beneficial or detrimental effects in 
      the CNS, which probably depend on the context of tissue homoeostasis or pathology. 
      Therefore any potential therapeutic manipulation of TLRs will require an 
      understanding of the signals governing specific CNS disorders to achieve tailored 
      therapy.

TI  - [Recent neuropathology of parkinsonian syndromes].
PG  - 3S11-8
AB  - The understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying Parkinson's disease, 
      progressive supranuclear palsy, and multiple system atrophy has made significant 
      progress in the recent years. Lewy body appears to be principally made of 
      alpha-synuclein, a presynaptic protein. It also contains ubiquitin and some 
      components of the proteasome: this suggests that alteration of protein catabolism 
      may be involved in its formation. In favor of this hypothesis, it should be noted 
      that Parkin, a protein that is mutated in autosomal recessive Parkinson disease, is 
      a ubiquitin ligase. Immunohistochemistry has shown that alpha-synuclein accumulates 
      not only in the cell body of the neurones (Lewy body) but also in their processes 
      (Lewy neurites); it has emphasized the severity of the pathology in the nucleus 
      basalis of Meynert, amygdala, CA2-3 sector of the hippocampus and cerebral cortex. 
      Cortical Lewy bodies are not considered any more the marker of dementia with Lewy 
      bodies: they are, indeed, found in true Parkinson disease cases. In progressive 
      supranuclear palsy, 4 repeats tau accumulates in the cytoplasm of neurones and glia. 
      At electron microscopy, the accumulation is made of straight filaments. It involves 
      not only the neurones (where it is the main constituent of the neurofibrillary 
      tangles) but also the glia. Astrocytic tuft is to day considered the morphological 
      marker of progressive supranuclear palsy. Tau protein accumulates in the cell body 
      of the oligodendrocyte as a "coiled body"; the protein is also integrated in the 
      myelin sheath, when the cytoplasm of the oligodendrocyte wraps around the axon. This 
      explains the numerous "threads" that are visible in cases of progressive 
      supranuclear palsy. Striato-nigral degeneration, sporadic olivo-ponto-cerebellar 
      atrophy and primitive orthostatic hypotension are various clinico-pathologic aspects 
      of the same disorder: multiple system atrophy. It is also characterized by a 
      morphological marker: the accumulation of alpha-synuclein in the cytoplasm of glial 
      cells, particularly oligodendrocytes. The term synucleinopathy has been proposed to 
      describe both idiopathic Parkinson disease and multiple system atrophy. The reason 
      explaining the cellular topography of alpha-synuclein accumulation, neuronal in 
      Parkinson disease, glial in multiple system atrophy is still unknown.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease and 
      oligodendrocyte degeneration and white matter damage play a critical role in the 
      pathogenesis of AD. FGF/FGF receptor signaling have been implicated in diverse 
      cellular processes including cell apoptosis, survival, adhesion, migration, 
      differentiation, and proliferation, as well as key regulators of the development of 
      the central nervous system (including in axon guidance and synaptogenesis) via 
      multiple signal pathways. It has been demonstrated that FGF infusion or gene 
      transfer restores neurogenesis in subventricular zone and hippocampal functions in 
      aged mice and mouse models of AD and has therapeutic implications for neurocognitive 
      disorders. Besides, FGF receptor signaling in oligodendrocytes regulates myelin 
      sheath thickness via Erk1/2 MAPK and PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling, which sequentially 
      regulates progression through distinct stages of oligodendrocyte differentiation. 
      The effect could be effectively antagonized by the potent, selective tyrosine kinase 
      inhibitor of FGF receptor activity. We therefore propose that modulation of FGF 
      receptor signaling will suppress the development of oligodendrocyte degeneration and 
      myelin breakdown or white matter damage in mouse models or patients of AD and 
      improve or restore the pathological and clinical symptoms of cognitive decline, and 
      FGF receptor signaling with its inhibitors and/or gene transfer would serve as an 
      intervention and potential therapy for myelin breakdown and cognitive decline in AD.

TI  - Novel mechanisms and approaches in the study of neurodegeneration and 
      neuroprotection. a review.
PG  - 375-83
AB  - Cellular mechanisms involved in neurodegeneration and neuroprotection are continuing 
      to be explored, and this paper focuses on some novel discoveries that give further 
      insight into these processes. Oligodendrocytes and activated astroglia are likely 
      generators of the pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as the tumor necrosis factor 
      family and interleukin family, and these glial support cells express adhesion 
      receptors (e.g., VCAM) and release intercellular adhesion molecules (ICAM) that have 
      a major role in neuronal apoptosis. Even brief exposure to some substances, in 
      ontogeny and sometimes in adulthood, can have lasting effects on behaviors because 
      of their prominent toxicity (e.g., NMDA receptor antagonists) or because they 
      sensitize receptors (e.g., dopamine D2 agonists), possibly permanently, and thereby 
      alter behavior for the lifespan. Cell cycle genes which may be derived from 
      microglia, are the most-recent entry into the neuroprotection schema. 
      Neuroprotection afforded by some common substances (e.g., melatonin) and uncommon 
      substances [e.g., nicotine, green tea polyphenol (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate 
      (EGCG), trolox], ordinarily thought to be simple radical scavengers, now are thought 
      to invoke previously unsuspected cellular mechanisms in the process of 
      neuroprotection. Although Alzheimer's disease (AD) has features of a continuous 
      spectrum of neural and functional decline, in vivo PET imaging and and functional 
      magnetic resonance imaging, indicate that AD can be staged into an early phase 
      treatable by inhibitors of beta and gamma secretase; and a late phase which may be 
      more amenable to treatment by drugs that prevent or reverse tau phosphorylation. 
      Neural transplantation, thought to be the last hope for neurally injured patients 
      (e.g., Parkinsonians), may be displaced by non-neural tissue transplants (e.g., 
      human umbilical cord blood; Sertoli cells) which seem to provide similar 
      neurotrophic support and improved behavior - without posing the major ethical 
      dilemma of removing tissue from aborted fetuses. The objective of this paper is to 
      invite added research into the newly discovered (or postulated) novel mechanisms; 
      and to stimulate discovery of additional mechanisms attending neurodegeneration and 
      neuroprotection.

TI  - Distinct clinical and neuropathological features of G51D SNCA mutation cases 
      compared with SNCA duplication and H50Q mutation.
PG  - 41

AB  - BACKGROUND: We and others have described the neurodegenerative disorder caused by 
      G51D SNCA mutation which shares characteristics of Parkinson's disease (PD) and 
      multiple system atrophy (MSA). The objective of this investigation was to extend the 
      description of the clinical and neuropathological hallmarks of G51D mutant 
      SNCA-associated disease by the study of two additional cases from a further G51D 
      SNCA kindred and to compare the features of this group with a SNCA duplication case 
      and a H50Q SNCA mutation case. RESULTS: All three G51D patients were clinically 
      characterised by parkinsonism, dementia, visual hallucinations, autonomic 
      dysfunction and pyramidal signs with variable age at disease onset and levodopa 
      response. The H50Q SNCA mutation case had a clinical picture that mimicked 
      late-onset idiopathic PD with a good and sustained levodopa response. The SNCA 
      duplication case presented with a clinical phenotype of frontotemporal dementia with 
      marked behavioural changes, pyramidal signs, postural hypotension and transiently 
      levodopa responsive parkinsonism. Detailed post-mortem neuropathological analysis 
      was performed in all cases. All three G51D cases had abundant α-synuclein pathology 
      with characteristics of both PD and MSA. These included widespread cortical and 
      subcortical neuronal α-synuclein inclusions together with small numbers of 
      inclusions resembling glial cytoplasmic inclusions (GCIs) in oligodendrocytes. In 
      contrast the H50Q and SNCA duplication cases, had α-synuclein pathology resembling 
      idiopathic PD without GCIs. Phosphorylated α-synuclein was present in all inclusions 
      types in G51D cases but was more restricted in SNCA duplication and H50Q mutation. 
      Inclusions were also immunoreactive for the 5G4 antibody indicating their highly 
      aggregated and likely fibrillar state. CONCLUSIONS: Our characterisation of the 
      clinical and neuropathological features of the present small series of G51D SNCA 
      mutation cases should aid the recognition of this clinico-pathological entity. The 
      neuropathological features of these cases consistently share characteristics of PD 
      and MSA and are distinct from PD patients carrying the H50Q or SNCA duplication.

TI  - [An autopsied case of atypical presenile dementia which shows lobar atrophy, severe 
      neurofibrillary tangles and calcification].
PG  - 292-9
AB  - We report an autopsy case of atypical presenile dementia. Shibayama, Kosaka and 
      others had reported similar autopsy cases. These cases had the following common 
      pathologic characteristics: circumscribed cerebral atrophy, diffuse neurofibrillary 
      tangles (NFTs) noted in the cerebral cortex with few senile plaques (SPs), and 
      pathological calcification. We propose the term "dementia with cerebral 
      calcification and tangles" (DCCT) for this atypical presenile dementia. Our patient, 
      who was female and died at the age of 65 years, also exhibited these 
      characteristics. Her clinical diagnosis was Alzheimer's disease. She had developed 
      apparent dementia at the age of 55. Psychological and neurological symptoms such as 
      memory impairment, speech disturbance and abnormal behavior slowly progressed. 
      Gradually, she had become bedridden in her own home. When she was 65 years old, she 
      was admitted because of pneumonia, and died soon after. In the pathologic 
      examination of our patient, the brain weight was 850 g, and severe cerebral atrophy 
      predominant in the temporal lobe was noted. Microscopically, diffuse and numerous 
      NFTs were also found in the cerebral cortex and brain stem. Some NFTs were observed 
      in the dentate nucleus of the cerebellum. However, SPs were seldom noted. 
      Calcifications were also found in the putamen, globus pallidus and cerebellar 
      cortex. NFTs in our case had developed without the formation of SPs. The degree of 
      the NFT formation was correlated to the extent of cerebral cortical atrophy and 
      neuron loss. Therefore, we suspect that NFTs with neuron loss strongly contribute to 
      clinical symptoms such as dementia. The distribution of NFTs resembles that in 
      patients with Alzheimer's disease, they are more prominent in the temporal lobe in 
      our case. Although there has not been any discussion about the findings of glial 
      cells and neuropils in DCCT, our detailed examination showed argyrophilic structures 
      in glial cells and in neuropils. Most of the glial cells appeared to be 
      oligodendrocytes. Calcification is also a prominent characteristic of DCCT. Using 
      analytical electron microscopy, we examined the area of calcification in the globus 
      pallidus and cerebellum, and found an accumulation of both Fe and Ca. The role of 
      calcification in the pathogenesis, however, remains unclear. It is very important to 
      examine cases of atypical presenile dementia clinicopathologically, in order to 
      study the correlation between NFTs and SPs in neurological disease, and to 
      understand their pathogenetic significance.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a typical neurodegenerative disease in central nervous 
      system (CNS). Generally speaking, patients with severe AD are often accompanied with 
      cognitive impairment. Oligodendrocytes (OLs) are myelin-forming cells in CNS, and 
      myelin injury potentially has something to do with the cognitive impairment in AD. 
      Based on the previous experimental studies, it has been recognized that nitric oxide 
      (NO), as a signaling molecule, might have an influence on the axon and myelin by 
      affecting the energy transport mechanism of OLs through monocarboxylate transporter 
      1 (MCT1). Interestingly, a novel model of cell signaling----axo-myelinic synapse 
      (AMS) has been put forward. In the context of this model, chances are that a new way 
      is established in which NO can influence the pathogenesis of AD by down-regulating 
      the expression of MCT1. As a consequence, it may provide attractive prospective and 
      underlying drug targeting effects for the treatment of AD.

TI  - Correlation between intrathecal sulfatide and TNF-alpha levels in patients with 
      vascular dementia.
PG  - 207-11
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Subcortical vascular dementia (SVD) is associated with white matter 
      lesions and demyelination. The aim of the present study was to examine the 
      cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of TNF-alpha, a proinflammatory cytokine mediating 
      myelin damage, in SVD patients. The intrathecal TNF-alpha levels were related to the 
      clinical symptoms of dementia, as well as to intrathecal levels of sulfatide, a 
      marker of white matter degradation, and of neurofilament, a marker of neuronal 
      degeneration. METHODS: CSF levels of TNF-a, sulfatide and neurofilament were all 
      analyzed by immunoenzymatic procedures in 17 patients with SVD and in 26 healthy 
      controls. RESULTS: The intrathecal concentration of TNF-alpha was significantly 
      increased in SVD patients compared to healthy controls (p = 0.0001). The intrathecal 
      levels of TNF-alpha were significantly correlated (r = 0.6, p = 0.02) to the levels 
      of sulfatide, but not to the levels of neurofilament, (r = 0.08, NS). CONCLUSIONS: 
      We have demonstrated intrathecal production of TNF-alpha in SVD patients. The 
      correlation between TNF-a and sulfatide levels in the CSF suggests that this 
      apoptosis-inducing cytokine leads to the death of oligodendrocytes, thereby 
      contributing to white matter degeneration, a hallmark of SVD.

TI  - The neuropathology of a chromosome 17-linked autosomal dominant parkinsonism and 
      dementia ("pallido-ponto-nigral degeneration").
PG  - 588-601
AB  - A group of similar autosomal dominant hereditary neurodegenerative disorders have 
      been linked to chromosome 17 in thirteen kindreds. One of these disorders, known as 
      pallido-ponto-nigral degeneration (PPND), is characterized by extensive degeneration 
      of the globus pallidus and substantia nigra as well as accumulation of abnormally 
      phosphorylated tau proteins. The authors now present comprehensive data on the 
      cellular and molecular pathology of PPND, allowing its classification among 
      chromosome 17-linked neurodegenerative disorders as well as its classification among 
      sporadic and other familial tauopathies. First, we showed that PPND is characterized 
      by abundant ballooned neurons in neocortical and subcortical regions as well as by 
      tau-rich inclusions in the cytoplasm of neurons and oligodendroglia morphologically 
      similar to those seen in corticobasal degeneration (CBD), but in a distribution 
      pattern resembling progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP). Second, we demonstrated 
      that antibodies to phosphorylation-independent (Alz50, 133, 304, Tau-2, T-46) as 
      well as phosphorylation-dependent (AT8, PHF-6, 12E8, PHF-1, T3P, pS422) epitopes in 
      human tau proteins stain these glial and neuronal inclusions as intensely as they 
      stain CBD or PSP inclusions. Third, we probed PPND brain by Western blots using some 
      of the same anti-tau antibodies to reveal 2 tau immunobands with molecular weights 
      of 69 kD and 64 kD in gray and white matter extracts, as reported for both PSP and 
      CBD. Finally, electron microscopy showed that these abnormal tau proteins formed 
      flat twisted ribbons with a maximum diameter of 20 nanometers (nm) and a periodicity 
      of about 200 nm, resembling those reported in CBD. Based on this, we conclude that 
      PPND is a hereditary neurodegenerative disorder characterized by neuronal and glial 
      tau-rich inclusions formed from aggregated filaments and hyperphosphorylated tau 
      proteins and, hence, can be subcategorized into the tauopathy group of chromosome 
      17-linked neurodegenerative disorders. Further, since the morphologic and 
      biochemical lesions of PPND overlap with those seen in sporadic CBD and PSP, we 
      speculate that these disorders share common pathogenetic mechanisms.

TI  - CADASIL mutant NOTCH3(R90C) decreases the viability of HS683 oligodendrocytes via 
      apoptosis.
PG  - 273-280
LID - 10.1007/s11033-017-4107-2 [doi]
AB  - Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and 
      leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) is the most common hereditary cerebral small vessel 
      disease caused by mutations in NOTCH3. Prevailing models suggest that demyelination 
      occurs secondary to vascular pathology. However, in zebrafish, NOTCH3 is also 
      expressed in mature oligodendrocytes. Thus, we hypothesized that in addition to 
      vascular defects, mutant NOTCH3 may alter glial function in individuals with 
      CADASIL. The aim of this study was to characterize the direct effects of a mutant 
      NOTCH3 protein in HS683 oligodendrocytes. HS683 oligodendrocytes transfected with 
      wild-type NOTCH3, mutant NOTCH3(R90C), and empty control vector were used to study 
      the impact of the NOTCH3(R90C) mutant on its protein hydrolytic processing, cell 
      viability, apoptosis, autophagy, oxidative stress, and the related upstream events 
      using immunoblotting, immunofluorescence, RT-PCR, and flow cytometry. We determined 
      that HS683 oligodendrocytes transfected with mutant NOTCH3(R90C), which is the 
      hotspot mutation site-associated with CADASIL, exhibited aberrant NOTCH3 proteolytic 
      processing. Compared to cells overexpressing wild-type NOTCH3, cells overexpressing 
      NOTCH3(R90C) were less viable and had a higher rate of apoptosis. Immunoblotting 
      revealed that cells transfected with NOTCH3(R90C) had higher levels of intrinsic 
      mitochondrial apoptosis, extrinsic death receptor path-related apoptosis, and 
      autophagy compared with cells transfected with wild-type NOTCH3. This study suggests 
      that in patients with CADASIL, early defects in glia influenced by NOTCH3(R90C) may 
      directly contribute to white matter pathology in addition to secondary vascular 
      defects. This study provides a potential therapeutic target for the future treatment 
      of CADASIL.

AB  - As an extension of the brain, the spinal cord has unique properties which could 
      allow us to gain a better understanding of CNS pathology. The brain and cord share 
      the same cellular components, yet the latter is simpler in cytoarchitecture and 
      connectivity. In Alzheimer's research, virtually all focus is on brain pathology, 
      however it has been shown that transgenic Alzheimer's mouse models accumulate beta 
      amyloid plaques in spinal cord, suggesting that the cord possesses the same 
      molecular machinery and conditions for plaque formation. Here we report a 
      spatial-temporal map of plaque load in 5xFAD mouse spinal cord. We found that 
      plaques started to appear at 11 weeks, then exhibited a time dependent increase and 
      differential distribution along the cord. More plaques were found in cervical than 
      other spinal levels at all time points examined. Despite heavy plaque load at 6 
      months, the number of cervical motor neurons in 5xFAD mice is comparable to wild 
      type littermates. On detailed microscopic examination, fine beta amyloid-containing 
      and beta sheet-rich thread-like structures were found in the peri-axonal space of 
      many axons. Importantly, these novel structures appear before any plaque deposits 
      are visible in young mice spinal cord and they co-localize with axonal swellings at 
      later stages, suggesting that these thread-like structures might represent the 
      initial stages of plaque formation, and could play a role in axonal damage. 
      Additionally, we were able to demonstrate increasing myelinopathy in aged 5xFAD 
      mouse spinal cord using the lipid probe Nile Red with high resolution. Collectively, 
      we found significant amyloid pathology in grey and white matter of the 5xFAD mouse 
      spinal cord which indicates that this structure maybe a useful platform to study 
      mechanisms of Alzheimer's pathology and disease progression.

TI  - Distribution and signaling of TREM2/DAP12, the receptor system mutated in human 
      polycystic lipomembraneous osteodysplasia with sclerosing leukoencephalopathy 
      dementia.
PG  - 2617-28
AB  - Together with its adaptor protein, the adaptor protein of 12 kDa also known as KARAP 
      and TYROBP (DAP12), triggering receptor expressed in myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) is a 
      stimulatory membrane receptor of the immunoglobulin/lectin-like superfamily, well 
      known in myeloid cells. In humans, however, loss-of-function mutations of 
      TREM2/DAP12 leave myeloid cells unaffected but induce an autosomal recessive disease 
      characterized, together with bone cysts, by a spectrum of pathological lesions in 
      the cortex, thalamus and basal ganglia with clinical symptoms of progressive 
      dementia (polycystic lipomembraneous osteodysplasia with sclerosing 
      leukoencephalopathy). Nothing was known about the role of TREM2/DAP12 in brain cell 
      biology and physiology. By confocal immunocytochemistry we demonstrate that, in both 
      human and mouse cerebral cortex, TREM2/DAP12, strongly expressed by microglia, is 
      also present in a fraction of neurons but not in astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. In 
      contrast, in the hippocampal cortex TREM2-expressing neurons are rare. Both in 
      neurons and microglia the receptor appears to be located mostly intracellularly in a 
      discrete compartment(s) partially coinciding with (or adjacent to) the Golgi 
      complex/trans-Golgi network. Four nerve cell lines were identified as expressing the 
      intracellular receptor system. In living human microglia CHME-5 and glioblastoma 
      T98G cells, activation of TREM2 by its specific antibody induced [Ca2+]i responses, 
      documenting its surface expression and functioning. Surface expression of TREM2, low 
      in resting CHME-5 and T98G cells, increases significantly and transiently (60 min) 
      when cells are stimulated by ionomycin, as revealed by both surface biotinylation 
      and surface immunolabeling. Our results provide the first information about the 
      expression, distribution (mostly intracellular) and functioning of TREM2/DAP12 
      system in nerve cells, a necessary step in the understanding of the cellular 
      mechanisms affected in polycystic lipomembraneous osteodysplasia with sclerosing 
      leukoencephalopathy.

AB  - We have reported earlier that tight-junction proteins are detectable by standard 
      immunohistochemistry in the brain parenchyma, namely in the cell bodies of neurons, 
      astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes. Here we show, by projection to latent structures - 
      discriminate analysis (PLS-DA), that the immunohistochemical detection profile of 
      tight junction proteins clearly distinguishes the AD cases from healthy aging 
      controls and from the cases of dementia with a predominantly vascular pathology 
      underlying the symptoms (vascular dementia, VaD; cerebral autosomal dominant 
      arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy, CADASIL; and 
      cerebral amyloid angiopathy, CAA). Our findings might be valuable in the perspective 
      of developing biomarkers for AD.

TI  - Stem cell therapy for Alzheimer's disease.
PG  - 459-85
AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder which impairs 
      the memory and intellectual abilities of the affected individuals. Loss of episodic 
      as well as semantic memory is an early and principal feature. The basal forebrain 
      cholinergic system is the population of neurons most affected by the 
      neurodegenerative process. Extracellular as well as intracellular deposition of 
      beta-amyloid or Abeta (Abeta) protein, intracellular formation of neurofibrillary 
      tangles and neuronal loss are the neuropathological hallmarks of AD. In the last few 
      years, hopes were raised that cell replacement therapy would provide cure by 
      compensating the lost neuronal systems. Stem cells obtained from embryonic as well 
      as adult tissue and grafted into the intact brain of mice or rats were mostly 
      followed by their incorporation into the host parenchyma and differentiation into 
      functional neural lineages. In the lesioned brain, stem cells exhibited targeted 
      migration towards the damaged regions of the brain, where they engrafted, 
      proliferated and matured into functional neurones. Neural precursor cells can be 
      intravenously administered and yet migrate into brain damaged areas and induce 
      functional recovery. Observations in animal models of AD have provided evidence that 
      transplanted stem cells or neural precursor cells (NPCs) survive, migrate, and 
      differentiate into cholinergic neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes with 
      amelioration of the learning/memory deficits. Besides replacement of lost or damaged 
      cells, stem cells stimulate endogenous neural precursors, enhance structural 
      neuroplasticity, and down regulate proinflammatory cytokines and neuronal apoptotic 
      death. Stem cells could also be genetically modified to express growth factors into 
      the brain. In the last years, evidence indicated that the adult brain of mammals 
      preserves the capacity to generate new neurons from neural stem/progenitor cells. 
      Inefficient adult neurogenesis may contribute to the pathogenesis of AD and other 
      neurodegenerative disorders. An attempt at mobilizing this endogenous pool of 
      resident stem-like cells provides another attractive approach for the treatment of 
      AD. Studies in patients with AD indicated decreased hippocampal volume derived by 
      neurodegeneration. Intriguingly, many drugs including antidepressants, lithium, 
      acetyl cholinesterase inhibitors, and ginkgo biloba, were able to enhance the 
      impaired neurogenesis in this disease process. This paved the way towards exploring 
      the possible pharmacological manipulation of neurogenesis which would offer an 
      alternative approach for the treatment of AD.

AB  - Human brain imaging has seen many advances in the quantification of white matter 
      in vivo. For example, these advances have revealed the association between white 
      matter damage and vascular disease as well as their impact on risk for and 
      development of dementia and depression in an aging population. Current neuroimaging 
      methods to quantify white matter damage provide a foundation for understanding such 
      age-related neuropathology; however, these methods are not as adept at determining 
      the underlying microstructural abnormalities signaling at risk tissue or driving 
      white matter damage in the aging brain. This review will begin with a brief overview 
      of the use of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in understanding white matter 
      alterations in aging before focusing in more detail on select advances in both 
      diffusion-based methods and multi-component relaxometry techniques for imaging white 
      matter microstructural integrity within myelin sheaths and the axons they encase. 
      Although DTI greatly extended the field of white matter interrogation, these more 
      recent technological advances will add clarity to the underlying microstructural 
      mechanisms that contribute to white matter damage. More specifically, the methods 
      highlighted in this review may prove more sensitive (and specific) for determining 
      the contribution of myelin versus axonal integrity to the aging of white matter in 
      brain.

PG  - 23-31
AB  - Many neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease 
      are now characterized by abnormal accumulation of certain proteins in the brain. The 
      key molecules include amyloid beta-protein (Abeta), tau and a-synuclein, all of 
      which are involved in the pathogenesis and provide histopathological hallmarks of 
      the diseases. Abeta is continuously produced in and removed from the brain. 
      Microglia and astrocytes take up and degrade soluble Abeta. In the Alzheimer brain, 
      once-deposited, insoluble Abeta is also removed by phagocytosis by activated 
      microglia. The success of these removal processes, however, is at best partial. The 
      phagocytic removal of insoluble Abeta is associated with neuroinflammation, a 
      potentially neurotoxic reaction. Tau is accumulated in astrocytes under a diversity 
      of pathological conditions in several forms: thorn-shaped astrocytes; tuft-shaped 
      astrocytes; astrocytic plaques. Thorn-shaped astrocytes are associated with gliosis 
      and are not disease-specific. Tuft-shaped astrocytes are characteristic of 
      progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and astrocytic plaques of cortico-basal 
      degeneration (CBD). Tau accumulation in oligodendrocytes is referred to as coiled 
      bodies and occurs in PSP, CBD, Pick's disease and some other so-called taupathies. 
      a-Synuclein is accumulated in oligodendrocytes, which is referred to as glial 
      cytoplasmic inclusions (GCI). Occurrence of GCI is diagnostic to multiple system 
      atrophy. Transgenic mouse models in which tau or alpha-synuclein is overexpressed in 
      glial cells indicate that neuronal degeneration occurs following tau/alpha-synuclein 
      accumulation in glial cells, supporting a notion that these abnormal glial cells 
      play pathogenic roles.

TI  - Two brothers with frontotemporal dementia and parkinsonism with an N279K mutation of 
      the tau gene.
PG  - 1787-95
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To characterize the clinical diagnostic features, neuropathologic 
      phenotype of tau deposition, and subunit structure of tau filaments in patients who 
      had an asparagine-to-lysine substitution at codon 279 (the N279K missense mutation) 
      of the gene for microtubule-associated tau protein. BACKGROUND: The N279K mutation 
      is a causative genetic defect for pallidopontonigral degeneration in an American 
      kindred that presents with frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and parkinsonism. METHODS: 
      The authors analyzed retrospectively the clinical symptoms of two Japanese brothers 
      who carry this mutation. Postmortem neuropathologic and electron microscopic 
      studies, and Western blot analysis of insoluble tau were performed to correlate 
      tau-mediated lesions with neurologic deficits. RESULTS: Both patients exhibited 
      impairment in recent memory, parkinsonism, and corticospinal disturbances in 
      addition to FTD. Parkinsonism in one patient was responsive temporarily to l-dopa. 
      There was intense tau deposition in the medial temporal cortices and upper and lower 
      motor neurons with accompanying corticospinal tract degeneration. Two distinct tau 
      isoforms with four microtubule-binding repeats, in hyperphosphorylated forms, were 
      the primary constituents of insoluble tau, which aggregated to the filamentous 
      component, termed "paired tubules," in neurons, oligodendrocytes, and astrocytes. 
      The elemental filaments were hollow tubules measuring 11 to 12 nm in diameter, two 
      of which adhered to each other along their longitudinal axes to form "paired 
      tubules." CONCLUSIONS: Early memory loss and pyramidal signs, which are atypical of 
      FTD, can be presenting symptoms in this disorder. The authors demonstrated that the 
      subunit structure of tau filaments is a pair of hollow tubules despite the 
      prevailing twisted ribbon model.

TI  - Interactions between astrocytes and oligodendroglia in human and experimental 
      Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease and scrapie.
PG  - 227-34
AB  - We report here a rare interaction between reactive astrocytes and oligodendrocytes, 
      first detected in a brain biopsy of human Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) and then 
      in experimental CJD in mice and in two models (263K and 22CH) of scrapie in 
      hamsters. In human CJD brain biopsy, low-power electron microscopy revealed numerous 
      examples of astrocytes and oligodendroglial cells in close apposition. At higher 
      magnification, both types of cells were occasionally connected by adhesive plaque 
      junctions (attenuated desmosomes). More complex structures were also seen. 
      Astrocytic cytoplasm was penetrated by oligodendroglial processes or 
      oligodendroglial cells were completely surrounded by astrocytic processes. An 
      analogous phenomenon was identified in the brains of CJD-infected mice and in two 
      models of scrapie-infected hamsters. In the CJD brain biopsy and in brain specimens 
      from CJD-infected mice and scrapie-infected hamsters, GFAP-immunoreactive 
      hypertrophic astrocytes were readily identified, particularly in those areas where 
      the tissue damage was the most extensive. Oligodendrocytes frequently surrounded 
      hypertrophic astrocytic processes or cell bodies and remained unstained in GFAP 
      preparation. The significance of the interactions between astrocytes and 
      oligodendrocytes is unclear at the present time. As in MS and other brain 
      pathologies in which it has been studied, this interaction is not associated with a 
      reaction toward any infectious pathogen but it may be an early cellular event that 
      triggers further brain tissue destruction.

TI  - Oligodendrocytes damage in Alzheimer's disease: beta amyloid toxicity and 
      inflammation.
PG  - 381-7
AB  - Research on Alzheimer's disease (AD) focuses mainly on neuronal death and synaptic 
      impairment induced by beta-Amyloid peptide (Abeta), events at least partially 
      mediated by astrocyte and microglia activation. However, substantial white matter 
      damage and its consequences on brain function warrant the study of oligodendrocytes 
      participation in the pathogenesis and progression of AD. Here, we analyze reports on 
      oligodendrocytes' compromise in AD and discuss some experimental data indicative of 
      Abeta toxicity in culture. We observed that 1 microM of fibrilogenic Abeta peptide 
      damages oligodendrocytes in vitro: while pro-inflammatory molecules (1 microg/ ml 
      LPS + 1 ng/ml IFNgamma) or the presence of astrocytes reduced the Abeta-induced 
      damage. This agrees with our previous results showing an astrocyte-mediated 
      protective effect over Abeta-induced damage on hippocampal cells and modulation of 
      the activation of microglial cells in culture. Oligodendrocytes protection by 
      astrocytes could be, either by reduction of Abeta fibrilogenesis/deposition or 
      prevention of oxidative damage. Likewise, the decrease of Abeta-induced damage by 
      proinflammatory molecules could reflect the production of trophic factors by 
      activated oligodendrocytes and/or a metabolic activation as observed during 
      myelination. Considering the association of inflammation with neurodegenerative 
      diseases. oligodendrocytes impairment in AD patients could potentiate cell damage 
      under pathological conditions.

TI  - Triangulated mal-signaling in Alzheimer's disease: roles of neurotoxic ceramides, ER 
      stress, and insulin resistance reviewed.
PG  - S231-49
LID - 10.3233/JAD-2012-111727 [doi]
AB  - Ceramides are lipid signaling molecules that cause cytotoxicity and cell death 
      mediated by insulin resistance, inflammation, and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. 
      However, insulin resistance dysregulates lipid metabolism, which promotes ceramide 
      accumulation with attendant inflammation and ER stress. Herein, we discuss two major 
      pathways, extrinsic and intrinsic, that converge and often overlap in propagating 
      AD-type neurodegeneration via a triangulated mal-signaling network. First, we review 
      evidence that systemic insulin resistance diseases linked to obesity, type 2 
      diabetes, and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis promote neurodegeneration. 
      Mechanistically, we propose that toxic ceramides generated in extra-CNS tissues 
      (e.g., liver) get released into peripheral blood, and subsequently transit across 
      the blood-brain barrier into the brain where they induce brain insulin resistance, 
      inflammation, and cell death (extrinsic pathway). Then we discuss the role of the 
      intrinsic pathway of neurodegeneration which is mediated by endogenous or primary 
      brain insulin/IGF resistance, and impairs neuronal and oligodendrocyte survival, 
      energy metabolism, membrane integrity, cytoskeletal function, and AβPP-Aβ secretion. 
      The end result is increased ER stress and ceramide generation, which exacerbate 
      brain insulin resistance, cell death, myelin degeneration, and neuroinflammation. 
      Altogether, the data suggest that the triangulated mal-signaling network mediated by 
      toxic ceramides, ER stress, and insulin resistance should be targeted to disrupt 
      positive feedback loops that drive the AD neurodegeneration cascade.

TI  - Glial dysfunction in the pathogenesis of α-synucleinopathies: emerging concepts.
PG  - 675-93
LID - 10.1007/s00401-011-0833-z [doi]
AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and multiple system 
      atrophy (MSA) are adult onset neurodegenerative disorders characterised by prominent 
      intracellular α-synuclein aggregates (α-synucleinopathies). The glial contribution 
      to neurodegeneration in α-synucleinopathies was largely underestimated until 
      recently. However, brains of PD and DLB patients exhibit not only neuronal 
      inclusions such as Lewy bodies or Lewy neurites but also glial α-synuclein 
      aggregates. Accumulating experimental evidence in PD models suggests that 
      astrogliosis and microgliosis act as important mediators of neurodegeneration 
      playing a pivotal role in both disease initiation and progression. In MSA, 
      oligodendrocytes are intriguingly affected by aberrant cytoplasmic accumulation of 
      α-synuclein (glial cytoplasmic inclusions, Papp-Lantos bodies). Converging evidence 
      from human postmortem studies and transgenic MSA models suggests that 
      oligodendroglial dysfunction both triggers and exacerbates neuronal degeneration. 
      This review summarises the wide range of responsibilities of astroglia, microglia 
      and oligodendroglia in the healthy brain and the changes in glial function 
      associated with ageing. We then provide a critical analysis of the role of glia in 
      α-synucleinopathies including putative mechanisms promoting a chronically diseased 
      glial microenvironment which can lead to detrimental neuronal changes, including 
      cell loss. Finally, major therapeutic strategies targeting glial pathology in 
      α-synucleinopathies as well as current pitfalls for disease-modification in clinical 
      trials are discussed.

TI  - Gradual Carotid Artery Stenosis in Mice Closely Replicates Hypoperfusive Vascular 
      Dementia in Humans.
LID - 10.1161/JAHA.115.002757 [doi]
LID - e002757
AB  - BACKGROUND: Existing rodent models of vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) show 
      abrupt changes in cerebral blood flow (CBF) and do not reliably replicate the 
      clinical pathogenesis of VCI. We therefore aimed to develop a mouse model of VCI 
      where CBF is gradually reduced, followed by subsequent progressive motor and 
      cognitive impairment, after surgical intervention. METHODS AND RESULTS: Adult 
      C57BL/6J male mice were subjected to gradual common carotid artery stenosis (GCAS) 
      surgery by using an ameroid constrictor vessel-constricting device with an inner 
      diameter of 0.75 mm. The common carotid arteries narrowed gradually after gradual 
      constriction of ameroid constrictors over 28 days after GCAS, with subsequent 79.3% 
      area stenosis as a result of smooth muscle cell proliferation and macrophage 
      infiltration in the tunica intima. The 28-day survival rate was 91%. Arterial spin 
      labeling demonstrated gradual and continuous reduction of cortical and subcortical 
      CBF (ratio to the preoperative value) to 54.6% and 51.5%, respectively, over 28 
      days. However, magnetic resonance angiography showed increment of collateral flow 
      signals in the leptomeningeal artery. Rarefaction and proliferation of astrocytes 
      and microglia, with loss of oligodendrocytes, were found in the white matter at 32 
      days. Hippocampal neuronal loss was observed in only 25% of GCAS mice, consistent 
      with lack of abnormalities in the Morris water maze test. The rotarod test showed 
      motor impairment, and the Y-maze test showed working memory deficits. CONCLUSIONS: 
      The GCAS model successfully generated gradual and continuous CBF reduction over 28 
      days, with replication of key histological, radiological, and behavioral features 
      associated with cerebral hypoperfusion leading to VCI.

AB  - Brain white matter lesions (WMLs), which are often observed in patients with 
      ischemic cerebrovascular diseases, contribute to cognitive decline. We analyzed the 
      pathologic and regenerative processes in brain white matter lesions of patients 
      diagnosed with vascular dementia. There was a significant increase in the number of 
      oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) in the brains of patients with vascular 
      dementia as well as in rats with cerebral hypoperfusion. WMLs can be induced 
      experimentally by bilateral common carotid artery ligation (BCCAL) of rats to cause 
      chronic cerebral ischemia. After chronic cerebral hypoperfusion injury, oxygen free 
      radicals and activated microglia acting as inflammatory elements contribute to 
      chronic cerebral hypoperfusion-induced WMLs. The cell death of oligodendrocytes 
      (OLGs) contributes directly to WMLs. The activation for intracellular signaling 
      pathway of cAMP responsive element binding protein (CREB) phosphorylation in the 
      white matter was suppressed after BCCAL. Type III phosphodiesterase inhibitor 
      (PDE3-I) has potential therapeutic and brain-protective effects based on multitarget 
      mechanism through cell signaling pathway of CREB phosphorylation. The OPCs 
      subsequently underwent cell death and the number of OLGs decreased. In the rat 
      model, PDE3-I prevented cell death, markedly increased the mature OLGs, and promoted 
      restoration of white matter and recovery of cognitive decline.

TI  - Multiple system atrophy: cellular and molecular pathology.
PG  - 419-26
AB  - Multiple system atrophy is an adult onset neurodegenerative disease, featuring 
      parkinsonism, ataxia, and autonomic failure, in any combination. The condition is 
      relentlessly progressive and responds poorly to treatment. Death occurs on average 
      six to seven years after the onset of symptoms. No familial cases of multiple system 
      atrophy have been reported, and no environmental factors have been robustly 
      implicated as aetiological factors. However, analytical epidemiological studies are 
      hampered because the condition is relatively rare. The discovery of the glial 
      cytoplasmic inclusion (GCI) in 1989 helped to define multiple system atrophy as a 
      clinicopathological entity, and drew attention to the prominent, if not primary, 
      role played by the oligodendrocyte in the pathogenesis of the condition. 
      Subsequently, GCIs were shown to be positive for alpha-synuclein, with 
      immunostaining for this protein indicating that white matter pathology was more 
      widespread than had previously been recognised. The presence of alpha-synuclein in 
      GCIs provides a link with Parkinson's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, and 
      neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation, type 1 (or Hallervorden-Spatz 
      syndrome), in which alpha-synuclein is also found within Lewy bodies. This has led 
      to the term "synucleinopathy" to embrace this group of conditions. The GCIs of 
      multiple system atrophy contain a range of other cytoskeletal proteins. It is 
      unknown how fibrillogenesis occurs, and whether there is primary oligodendrocytic 
      dysfunction, which then disrupts the neurone/axon as a consequence of the glial 
      pathology, or whether the oligodendrocytic changes merely represent an 
      epiphenomenon. Further research into this devastating condition is urgently needed 
      to improve our understanding of the pathogenesis, and also to produce new treatment 
      approaches.

TI  - Neuron-glia interactions as therapeutic targets in neurodegeneration.
PG  - 485-502
LID - 10.3233/JAD-2009-0988 [doi]
AB  - Accumulating evidence suggests that alterations of neuron-glia interactions are 
      associated with development of neurodegenerative diseases referred to as taupathies. 
      Astrocytes contribute to a variety of functions of neurons, including synapse 
      formation and plasticity, energetic and redox metabolism, and synaptic homeostasis 
      of neurotransmitters and ions. Microglia represent the immune system of the brain 
      and therefore are critically involved in various injuries and diseases. 
      Oligodendrocytes have a role in regulation of steroid synthesis which is important 
      for neuroprotection against degeneration. Glia-mediated inflammatory response is 
      involved in dramatic changes in activity of neuritic plaque-associated astrocytes 
      and microglia, and the link between glial activation and neuronal damage or repair 
      has been postulated. In addition, functional relationship between neurons, glial 
      cells, and vascular cells within so-called neurovascular unit is dramatically 
      compromised in Alzheimer's disease. Therefore, importance of alterations in 
      synergistic interactions between the cells in pathogenesis of this neurodegenerative 
      disorder has been suggested. Further understanding of molecular mechanisms of 
      neuron-glia interactions in Alzheimer's disease would give us novel diagnostic and 
      therapeutic strategies.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by the deposition of beta-amyloid peptides 
      (Abeta) and a progressive loss of neurons leading to dementia. Because hippocampal 
      neurogenesis is linked to functions such as learning, memory and mood, there has 
      been great interest in examining the effects of AD on hippocampal neurogenesis. This 
      article reviews the pertinent studies and tries to unite them in one possible 
      disease model. Early in the disease, oligomeric Abeta may transiently promote the 
      generation of immature neurons from neural stem cells (NSCs). However, reduced 
      concentrations of multiple neurotrophic factors and higher levels of fibroblast 
      growth factor-2 seem to induce a developmental arrest of newly generated neurons. 
      Furthermore, fibrillary Abeta and down-regulation of oligodendrocyte-lineage 
      transcription factor-2 (OLIG2) may cause the death of these nonfunctional neurons. 
      Therefore, altering the brain microenvironment for fostering apt maturation of 
      graft-derived neurons may be critical for improving the efficacy of NSC 
      transplantation therapy for AD.

TI  - Mitochondrial mechanisms in amyloid beta peptide-induced cerebrovascular 
      degeneration.
PG  - 290-6
LID - 10.1016/j.bbagen.2009.08.003 [doi]
AB  - Prevailing evidence suggests that amyloid beta peptide (Abeta), a key mediator in 
      age-dependent neuronal and cerebrovascular degeneration, activates death signaling 
      processes leading to neuronal as well as non-neuronal cell death in the central 
      nervous system. A major cellular event in Abeta-induced death of non-neuronal cells, 
      including cerebral endothelial cells, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes, is 
      mitochondrial dysfunction. The death signaling cascade upstream of mitochondria 
      entails Abeta activation of neutral sphingomyelinase, resulting in the release of 
      ceramide from membrane sphingomyelin. Ceramide then activates protein phosphatase 2A 
      (PP2A), a member in the ceramide-activated protein phosphatase (CAPP) family. PP2A 
      dephosphorylation of Akt and FKHRL1 plays a pivotal role in Abeta-induced Bad 
      translocation to mitochondria and transactivation of Bim. Bad and Bim are 
      pro-apoptotic proteins that cause mitochondrial dysfunction characterized by 
      excessive ROS formation, mitochnondrial DNA (mtDNA) damage, and release of 
      mitochondrial apoptotic proteins including cytochrome c, apoptosis inducing factor 
      (AIF), endonuclease G and Smac. The cellular events activated by Abeta to induce 
      death of non-neuronal cells are complex. Understanding these death signaling 
      processes will aid in the development of more effective strategies to slow down 
      age-dependent cerebrovascular degeneration caused by progressive cerebrovascular 
      Abeta deposition.

TI  - Heterogeneity of small vessel disease: a systematic review of MRI and histopathology 
      correlations.
PG  - 126-35
LID - 10.1136/jnnp.2009.204685 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: White matter hyperintensities (WMH), lacunes and microbleeds are 
      regarded as typical MRI expressions of cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) and they 
      are highly prevalent in the elderly. However, clinical expression of MRI defined SVD 
      is generally moderate and heterogeneous. By reviewing studies that directly 
      correlated postmortem MRI and histopathology, this paper aimed to characterise the 
      pathological substrates of SVD in order to create more understanding as to its 
      heterogeneous clinical manifestation. SUMMARY: Postmortem studies showed that WMH 
      are also heterogeneous in terms of histopathology. Damage to the tissue ranges from 
      slight disentanglement of the matrix to varying degrees of myelin and axonal loss. 
      Glial cell responses include astrocytic reactions--for example, astrogliosis and 
      clasmatodendrosis--as well as loss of oligodendrocytes and distinct microglial 
      responses. Lipohyalinosis, arteriosclerosis, vessel wall leakage and collagen 
      deposition in venular walls are recognised microvascular changes. Suggested 
      pathogenetic mechanisms are ischaemia/hypoxia, hypoperfusion due to altered 
      cerebrovascular autoregulation, blood-brain barrier leakage, inflammation, 
      degeneration and amyloid angiopathy. Only a few postmortem MRI studies have 
      addressed lacunes and microbleeds to date. Cortical microinfarcts and changes in the 
      normal appearing white matter are 'invisible' on conventional MRI but are 
      nevertheless expected to contribute substantially to clinical symptoms. CONCLUSION: 
      Pathological substrates of WMH are heterogeneous in nature and severity, which may 
      partly explain the weak clinicoradiological associations found in SVD. Lacunes and 
      microbleeds have been relatively understudied and need to be further investigated. 
      Future studies should also take into account 'MRI invisible' SVD features and 
      consider the use of, for example, quantitative MRI techniques, to increase the 
      sensitivity of MRI for these abnormalities and study their effects on clinical 
      functioning.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Comparative transcriptome analyses in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and 
      other neurodegenerative proteinopathies can uncover both shared and distinct disease 
      pathways. METHODS: We analyzed 940 brain transcriptomes including patients with AD, 
      progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP; a primary tauopathy), and control subjects. 
      RESULTS: We identified transcriptional coexpression networks implicated in 
      myelination, which were lower in PSP temporal cortex (TCX) compared with AD. Some of 
      these associations were retained even after adjustments for brain cell population 
      changes. These TCX myelination network structures were preserved in cerebellum but 
      they were not differentially expressed in cerebellum between AD and PSP. Myelination 
      networks were downregulated in both AD and PSP, when compared with control TCX 
      samples. DISCUSSION: Downregulation of myelination networks may underlie both PSP 
      and AD pathophysiology, but may be more pronounced in PSP. These data also highlight 
      conservation of transcriptional networks across brain regions and the influence of 
      cell type changes on these networks.

TI  - Nogo receptor blockade overcomes remyelination failure after white matter stroke and 
      stimulates functional recovery in aged mice.
PG  - E8453-E8462
LID - 10.1073/pnas.1615322113 [doi]
AB  - White matter stroke is a distinct stroke subtype, accounting for up to 25% of stroke 
      and constituting the second leading cause of dementia. The biology of possible 
      tissue repair after white matter stroke has not been determined. In a mouse stroke 
      model, white matter ischemia causes focal damage and adjacent areas of axonal myelin 
      disruption and gliosis. In these areas of only partial damage, local white matter 
      progenitors respond to injury, as oligodendrocyte progenitors (OPCs) proliferate. 
      However, OPCs fail to mature into oligodendrocytes (OLs) even in regions of 
      demyelination with intact axons and instead divert into an astrocytic fate. Local 
      axonal sprouting occurs, producing an increase in unmyelinated fibers in the corpus 
      callosum. The OPC maturation block after white matter stroke is in part mediated via 
      Nogo receptor 1 (NgR1) signaling. In both aged and young adult mice, stroke induces 
      NgR1 ligands and down-regulates NgR1 inhibitors during the peak OPC maturation 
      block. Nogo ligands are also induced adjacent to human white matter stroke in 
      humans. A Nogo signaling blockade with an NgR1 antagonist administered after stroke 
      reduces the OPC astrocytic transformation and improves poststroke oligodendrogenesis 
      in mice. Notably, increased white matter repair in aged mice is translated into 
      significant poststroke motor recovery, even when NgR1 blockade is provided during 
      the chronic time points of injury. These data provide a perspective on the role of 
      NgR1 ligand function in OPC fate in the context of a specific and common type of 
      stroke and show that it is amenable to systemic intervention to promote recovery.

TI  - Myelin Basic Protein Citrullination, a Hallmark of Central Nervous System 
      Demyelination, Assessed by Novel Monoclonal Antibodies in Prion Diseases.
PG  - 3172-3184
LID - 10.1007/s12035-017-0560-0 [doi]
AB  - Myelin basic protein (MBP) citrullination by peptidylarginine deiminase (PAD) 
      enzymes leads to incomplete protein-lipid bilayer interactions and vulnerability to 
      proteolytic enzymes, resulting in disorganization of the myelin sheath in the 
      central nervous system. Therefore, citrullinated MBP (citMBP) has been suggested as 
      a hallmark of demyelination, but how citMBP is implicated in prion diseases remains 
      unknown. For the first time, we developed mouse monoclonal anti-citMBP IgG1 (clones 
      1B8, 1H1, and 3C6) and IgM (clone 3G5) antibodies that recognize human citMBP at its 
      R25, R122, and R130 residues and at its C-terminal region (or the corresponding 
      sites in mouse MBP), respectively. Using a biochemical, immunohistochemical, and 
      immunogold-silver staining for electron microscopy techniques, we found that MBP 
      residue R23 (corresponding to human R25) was specifically citrullinated, was stained 
      as intense punctae in the corpus callosum, the striatum, and the cerebellar white 
      matter, and was predominantly localized in disorganized myelin in the brains of 
      scrapie-infected mice. In the brains of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) patients, 
      MBP residues R25, R122, and R130 were markedly citrullinated and were stained as 
      fibrils and punctae. In particular, white matter regions, such as the midbrain and 
      the medulla, exhibited high levels of citMBP compared to other regions. However, the 
      high levels of citMBP were not correlated with PAD2 expression. The clone 3G5 
      recognized significantly increased expression of the 18.5 kDa and/or 21.5 kDa 
      variants of MBP in prion disease. Our findings suggest that significantly increased 
      levels of citMBP may reflect demyelinating neuropathology, and that these newly 
      developed antibodies may be useful for identifying demyelination.

TI  - Accumulation of phosphorylated α-synuclein in subpial and periventricular astrocytes

AB  - The histological hallmark of multiple system atrophy (MSA) is accumulation of 
      phosphorylated α-synuclein in oligodendrocytes. However, it is uncertain whether 
      phosphorylated α-synuclein accumulates in astrocytes of MSA patients. We 
      immunohistochemically examined the frontal and temporal lobes, basal ganglia, 
      cerebellum, brainstem and spinal cord of patients with MSA (n = 15) and Lewy body 
      disease (n = 20), and also in control subjects (n = 20). Accumulation of abnormally 
      phosphorylated and aggregated α-synuclein was found in subpial and periventricular 
      astrocytes in six of the 15 patients with MSA (40%). The structures were confined to 
      the subpial surface of the ventro-lateral part of the spinal cord and brainstem, as 
      well as the subependymal region of the lateral ventricles. They were not visualized 
      by Gallyas-Braak staining, and were immunonegative for ubiquitin and p62. 
      Immunoelectron microscopy revealed that the phosphorylated 
      α-synuclein-immunoreactive structures in astrocytes were non-fibrillar and 
      associated with granular and vesicular structures. The extent of phosphorylated 
      α-synuclein-immunoreactive astrocytes was correlated with disease duration. No such 
      structures were found in Lewy body disease or controls. Accumulation of 
      phosphorylated α-synuclein can occur in subpial and periventricular astrocytes in 
      patients with MSA, especially in those with a long disease duration.

TI  - Cells of the central nervous system as targets and reservoirs of the human 
      immunodeficiency virus.
PG  - 194-213
AB  - The availability of highly active antiretroviral therapies (HAART) has not 
      eliminated HIV-1 infection of the central nervous system (CNS) or the occurrence of 
      HIV-associated neurological problems. Thus, the neurobiology of HIV-1 is still an 
      important issue. Here, we review key features of HIV-1-cell interactions in the CNS 
      and their contributions to persistence and pathogenicity of HIV-1 in the CNS. HIV-1 
      invades the brain very soon after systemic infection. Various mechanisms have been 
      proposed for HIV-1 entry into the CNS. The most favored hypothesis is the migration 
      of infected cells across the blood-brain barrier ("Trojan horse" hypothesis). Virus 
      production in the CNS is not apparent before the onset of AIDS, indicating that 
      HIV-1 replication in the CNS is successfully controlled in pre-AIDS. Brain 
      macrophages and microglia cells are the chief producers of HIV-1 in brains of 
      individuals with AIDS. HIV-1 enters these cells by the CD4 receptor and mainly the 
      CCR5 coreceptor. Various in vivo and cell culture studies indicate that cells of 
      neuroectodermal origin, particularly astrocytes, may also be infected by HIV-1. 
      These cells restrict virus production and serve as reservoirs for HIV-1. A limited 
      number of studies suggest restricted infection of oligodendrocytes and neurons, 
      although infection of these cells is still controversial. Entry of HIV-1 into 
      neuroectodermal cells is independent of the CD4 receptor, and a number of different 
      cell-surface molecules have been implicated as alternate receptors of HIV-1. 
      HIV-1-associated injury of the CNS is believed to be caused by numerous soluble 
      factors released by glial cells as a consequence of HIV-1 infection. These include 
      both viral and cellular factors. Some of these factors can directly induce neuronal 
      injury and death by interacting with receptors on neuronal membranes (neurotoxic 
      factors). Others can activate uninfected cells to produce inflammatory and 
      neurotoxic factors and/or promote infiltration of monocytes and T-lymphocytes, thus 
      amplifying the deleterious effects of HIV-1 infection. CNS responses to HIV-1 
      infection also include mechanisms that enhance neuronal survival and strengthen 
      crucial neuronal support functions. Future challenges will be to develop strategies 
      to prevent HIV-1 spread in the brain, bolster intrinsic defense mechanisms of the 
      brain and to elucidate the impact of long-term persistence of HIV-1 on CNS functions 
      in individuals without AIDS.

TI  - Tau-inclusion body formation in oligodendroglia: the role of stress proteins and 
      proteasome inhibition.
PG  - 443-51
AB  - Filamentous tau-positive inclusions in neurons and glia are a unifying mechanism 
      underlying a variety of late onset neurodegenerative disorders termed "tauopathies". 
      Oligodendroglial lesions and white matter pathology have long been underestimated 
      and are specifically prominent in frontotemporal dementias (FTDs), such as Pick's 
      disease (PiD), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), corticobasal degeneration (CBD) 
      and frontotemporal dementia with Parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17 (FTDP-17). 
      Oligodendrocytes contain an extensive microtubule network and express the 
      microtubule-associated protein tau. Tau-positive inclusion bodies in 
      oligodendrocytes are positively stained with antibodies against ubiquitin and heat 
      shock proteins (HSPs). Specifically the small HSP alphaB-crystallin has been 
      identified in oligodendroglial lesions. HSPs act as molecular chaperones and prevent 
      the accumulation of abnormal proteins, and support proteolytic degradation by 
      targeting non-reparable proteins to the ubiquitin proteasomal pathway. HSPs and the 
      proteasomal system closely work together. The present report summarizes recent data 
      on HSP induction and aggregate formation in oligodendroglia cell culture systems, 
      indicating that posttranslational modification of tau, HSP induction and alterations 
      of the proteasomal system, which might occur during aging and disease processes, are 
      involved in the neuropathological events leading to aggregate formation and 
      degeneration.

AB  - Immunoglobulins are proteins with a highly variable antigen-binding domain and a 
      constant region (Fc domain) that binds to a cell surface receptor (FcR). Activation 
      of FcRs in immune cells (lymphocytes, macrophages, and mast cells) triggers effector 
      responses including cytokine production, phagocytosis, and degranulation. In 
      addition to their roles in normal responses to infection or tissue injury, and in 
      immune-related diseases, FcRs are increasingly recognized for their involvement in 
      neurological disorders. One or more FcRs are expressed in microglia, astrocytes, 
      oligodendrocytes, and neurons. Aberrant activation of FcRs in such neural cells may 
      contribute to the pathogenesis of major neurodegenerative conditions including 
      Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, ischemic stroke, and multiple sclerosis. 
      On the other hand, FcRs may play beneficial roles in counteracting pathological 
      processes; for e.g., FcRs may facilitate removal of amyloid peptides from the brain 
      and so protect against Alzheimer's disease. Knowledge of the functions of FcRs in 
      the nervous system in health and disease is leading to novel preventative and 
      therapeutic strategies for stroke, Alzheimer's disease, and other neurological 
      disorders.

TI  - Myelin injury induces axonal transport impairment but not AD-like pathology in the 
      hippocampus of cuprizone-fed mice.
PG  - 30003-17
LID - 10.18632/oncotarget.8981 [doi]
AB  - Both multiple sclerosis (MS) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) are progressive 
      neurological disorders with myelin injury and memory impairment. However, whether 
      myelin impairment could cause AD-like neurological pathology remains unclear. To 
      explore neurological pathology following myelin injury, we assessed cognitive 
      function, the expression of myelin proteins, axonal transport-associated proteins, 
      axonal structural proteins, synapse-associated proteins, tau and beta amyloid and 
      the status of neurons, using the cuprizone mouse model of demyelination. We found 
      the mild impairment of learning ability in cuprizone-fed mice and the decreased 
      expression of myelin basic protein (MBP) in the hippocampus. And anti-LINGO-1 
      improved learning ability and partly restored MBP level. Furthermore, we also found 
      kinesin light chain (KLC), neurofilament light chain (NFL) and neurofilament heavy 
      chain (NF200) were declined in demyelinated hippocampus, which could be partly 
      improved by treatment with anti-LINGO-1. However, we did not observe the increased 
      expression of beta amyloid, hyperphosphorylation of tau and loss of neurons in 
      demyelinated hippocampus. Our results suggest that demyelination might lead to the 
      impairment of neuronal transport, but not cause increased level of 
      hyperphosphorylated tau and beta amyloid. Our research demonstrates remyelination 
      might be an effective pathway to recover the function of neuronal axons and 
      cognition in MS.

TI  - αB-Crystallin overexpression in astrocytes modulates the phenotype of the BACHD 
      mouse model of Huntington's disease.

AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is caused by an expanded polyglutamine (polyQ) tract in 
      the huntingtin (htt) protein. The polyQ expansion increases the propensity of htt to 
      aggregate and accumulate, and manipulations that mitigate protein misfolding or 
      facilitate the clearance of misfolded proteins are predicted to slow disease 
      progression in HD models. αB-crystallin (αBc) or HspB5 is a well-characterized 
      member of the small heat shock protein (sHsp) family that reduces mutant htt (mhtt) 
      aggregation and toxicity in vitro and in Drosophila models of HD. Here, we 
      determined if overexpressing αBc in vivo modulates aggregation and delays the onset 
      and progression of disease in a full-length model of HD, BACHD mice. Expression of 
      sHsps in neurodegenerative disease predominantly occurs in non-neuronal cells, and 
      in the brain, αBc is mainly found in astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. Here, we show 
      that directed αBc overexpression in astrocytes improves motor performance in rotarod 
      and balance beam tests and improves cognitive function in the BACHD mice. 
      Improvement in behavioral deficits correlated with mitigation of neuropathological 
      features commonly observed in HD. Interestingly, astrocytic αBc overexpression was 
      neuroprotective against neuronal cell loss in BACHD brains, suggesting αBc might be 
      acting in a non-cell-autonomous manner. At the protein level, αBc decreased the 
      level of soluble mhtt and decreased the size of mhtt inclusions in BACHD brain. Our 
      results support a model in which elevating astrocytic αBc confers neuroprotection 
      through a potential non-cell-autonomous pathway that modulates mhtt aggregation and 
      protein levels.

TI  - ABCA5 regulates amyloid-β peptide production and is associated with Alzheimer's 
      disease neuropathology.
PG  - 857-69
LID - 10.3233/JAD-141320 [doi]
AB  - Brain cholesterol homeostasis is regulated by a group of proteins called ATP-binding 
      cassette subfamily A (ABCA) transporters. Certain ABCA transporters regulate 
      amyloid-β protein precursor (AβPP) processing to generate amyloid-β peptides (Aβ) 
      and are associated with an increased risk for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD). 
      ABCA5 is a little-known member of the ABCA subfamily with no known function. In this 
      study we undertook a comprehensive analysis of ABCA5 expression in the human and 
      mouse brains. We explored the potential role of ABCA5 in AβPP processing associated 
      with AD pathology. ABCA5 was differentially expressed in multiple regions of both 
      human and mouse brains. It was strongly expressed in neurons with only weak 
      expression in microglia, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes. ABCA5 was able to 
      stimulate cholesterol efflux in neurons. ABCA5 expression was specifically elevated 
      in the hippocampus of AD brains. Using two in vitro cell systems we demonstrated 
      that ABCA5 reduces Aβ production, both Aβ40 and Aβ42, without altering AβPP mRNA and 
      protein levels, indicating that the decrease in the Aβ levels was due to changes in 
      AβPP processing and not AβPP expression. This report represents the first extensive 
      expression and functional study of ABCA5 in the human brain and our data suggest a 
      plausible function of ABCA5 in the brain as a cholesterol transporter associated 
      with Aβ generation, information that may offer a potential new target for 
      controlling Aβ levels in the brain.

TI  - Higher levels of myelin phospholipids in brains of neuronal α-Synuclein transgenic 
      mice precede myelin loss.
PG  - 37
LID - 10.1186/s40478-017-0439-3 [doi]
LID - 37
AB  - α-Synuclein is a protein involved in the pathogenesis of synucleinopathies, 
      including Parkinson's disease (PD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and multiple 
      system atrophy (MSA). We investigated the role of neuronal α-Syn in myelin 
      composition and abnormalities. The phospholipid content of purified myelin was 
      determined by (31)P NMR in two mouse lines modeling PD, PrP-A53T α-Syn and Thy-1 
      wt-α-Syn. Significantly higher levels of phospholipids were detected in myelin 
      purified from brains of these α-Syn transgenic mouse models than in control mice. 
      Nevertheless, myelin ultrastructure appeared intact. To further investigate the 
      effect of α-Syn on myelin abnormalities, we systematically analyzed the striatum, a 
      brain region associated with neurodegeneration in PD. An age and disease-dependent 
      loss of myelin basic protein (MBP) signal was detected by immunohistochemistry in 
      striatal striosomes (patches). The age-dependent loss of MBP signal was associated 
      with lower P25α levels in oligodendrocytes. In addition, we found that α-Syn 
      inhibited oligodendrocyte maturation and the formation of membranous sheets in 
      vitro. Based on these results we concluded that neuronal α-Syn is involved in the 
      regulation and/or maintenance of myelin phospholipid. However, axonal 
      hypomyelination in the PD models is evident only in progressive stages of the 
      disease and associated with α-Syn toxicity.

TI  - Myelin Breakdown in Human Huntington's Disease: Multi-Modal Evidence from Diffusion

AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) leads to white matter (WM) degeneration that may be due to 
      an early breakdown in axon myelination but in vivo imaging correlates of 
      demyelination remain relatively unexplored in HD compared to other neurodegenerative 
      diseases. This study investigated HD-related effects on a putative marker of myelin, 
      the macromolecular proton fraction (MMPF) from quantitative magnetization transfer 
      and on fractional anisotropy, axial and radial diffusivity from diffusion tensor 
      MR-imaging. Microstructural differences were studied in WM pathways of the basal 
      ganglia and motor systems known to be impaired in HD: the corpus callosum, the 
      cortico-spinal tract, the anterior thalamic radiation, fibers between prefrontal 
      cortex and caudate and between supplementary motor area and putamen. Principal 
      component analysis was employed for dimensionality reduction. Patients showed 
      reductions in a component with high loadings on MMPF in all WM pathways and a trend 
      for increases in a component loading on axial and radial diffusivities but no 
      differences in a component loading on fractional anisotropy. While patients' 
      performance in executive functioning was impaired, their working memory span was 
      preserved. Inter-individual differences in the diffusivity component correlated with 
      patients' performance in clinical measures of the United Huntington Disease Rating 
      Scale. In summary, HD-related reductions in MMPF suggest that myelin breakdown 
      contributes to WM impairment in human HD and emphasize the potential of quantitative 
      MRI metrics to inform about disease pathogenesis. Disease severity in manifest HD, 
      however, was best captured by non-specific diffusivity metrics sensitive to multiple 
      disease and age-related changes.

TI  - p25alpha Stimulates alpha-synuclein aggregation and is co-localized with aggregated 
      alpha-synuclein in alpha-synucleinopathies.
PG  - 5703-15
AB  - Aggregation of the nerve cell protein alpha-synuclein is a characteristic of the 
      common neurodegenerative alpha-synucleinopathies like Parkinson's disease and Lewy 
      body dementia, and it plays a direct pathogenic role as demonstrated by early onset 
      diseases caused by mis-sense mutations and multiplication of the alpha-synuclein 
      gene. We investigated the existence of alpha-synuclein pro-aggregatory brain 
      proteins whose dysregulation may contribute to disease progression, and we 
      identified the brain-specific p25alpha as a candidate that preferentially binds to 
      alpha-synuclein in its aggregated state. Functionally, purified recombinant human 
      p25alpha strongly stimulates the aggregation of alpha-synuclein in vitro as 
      demonstrated by thioflavin-T fluorescence and quantitative electron microscopy. 
      p25alpha is normally only expressed in oligodendrocytes in contrast to 
      alpha-synuclein, which is normally only expressed in neurons. This expression 
      pattern is changed in alpha-synucleinopathies. In multiple systems atrophy, 
      degenerating oligodendrocytes displayed accumulation of p25alpha and dystopically 
      expressed alpha-synuclein in the glial cytoplasmic inclusions. In Parkinson's 
      disease and Lewy body dementia, p25alpha was detectable in the neuronal Lewy body 
      inclusions along with alpha-synuclein. The localization in 
      alpha-synuclein-containing inclusions was verified biochemically by immunological 
      detection in Lewy body inclusions purified from Lewy body dementia tissue and glial 
      cytoplasmic inclusions purified from tissue from multiple systems atrophy. We 
      suggest that p25alpha plays a pro-aggregatory role in the common neurodegenerative 
      disorders hall-marked by alpha-synuclein aggregates.

TI  - Myelin breakdown and iron changes in Huntington's disease: pathogenesis and 
      treatment implications.
PG  - 1655-64
AB  - BACKGROUND: Postmortem and in vivo imaging data support the hypothesis that 
      premature myelin breakdown and subsequent homeostatic remyelination attempts with 
      increased oligodendrocyte and iron levels may contribute to Huntington's Disease 
      (HD) pathogenesis and the symmetrical progress of neuronal loss from 
      earlier-myelinating striatum to later-myelinating regions. A unique combination of 
      in vivo tissue integrity and iron level assessments was used to examine the 
      hypothesis. METHODS: A method that uses two Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 
      instruments operating at different field-strengths was used to quantify the iron 
      content of ferritin molecules (ferritin iron) as well as tissue integrity in eight 
      regions in 11 HD and a matched group of 27 healthy control subjects. Three white 
      matter regions were selected based on their myelination pattern (early to 
      later-myelinating) and fiber composition. These were frontal lobe white matter (Fwm) 
      and splenium and genu of the corpus callosum (Swm and Gwm). In addition, gray matter 
      structures were also chosen based on their myelination pattern and fiber 
      composition. Three striatum structures were assessed [caudate, putamen, and globus 
      pallidus (C, P, and G)] as well as two comparison gray matter regions that myelinate 
      later in development and are relatively spared in HD [Hippocampus (Hipp) and 
      Thalamus (Th)]. RESULTS: Compared to healthy controls, HD ferritin iron levels were 
      significantly increased in striatum C, P, and G, decreased in Fwm and Gwm, and were 
      unchanged in Hipp, Th, and Swm. Loss of tissue integrity was observed in C, P, Fwm, 
      and especially Swm but not Hipp, Th, G, or Gwm. This pattern of findings was largely 
      preserved when a small subset of HD subjects early in the disease process was 
      examined. CONCLUSIONS: The data suggest early in the HD process, myelin breakdown 
      and changes in ferritin iron distribution underlie the pattern of regional toxicity 
      observed in HD. Prospective studies are needed to verify myelin breakdown and 
      increased iron levels are causal factors in HD pathogenesis. Tracking the effects of 
      novel interventions that reduce myelin breakdown and iron accumulation in 
      preclinical stages of HD could hasten the development of preventive treatments.

AB  - Several common genetic variants influence cholesterol levels, which play a key role 
      in overall health. Myelin synthesis and maintenance are highly sensitive to 
      cholesterol concentrations, and abnormal cholesterol levels increase the risk for 
      various brain diseases, including Alzheimer's disease. We report significant 
      associations between higher serum cholesterol (CHOL) and high-density lipoprotein 
      levels and higher fractional anisotropy in 403 young adults (23.8 ± 2.4 years) 
      scanned with diffusion imaging and anatomic magnetic resonance imaging at 4 Tesla. 
      By fitting a multi-locus genetic model within white matter areas associated with 
      CHOL, we found that a set of 18 cholesterol-related, single-nucleotide polymorphisms 
      implicated in Alzheimer's disease risk predicted fractional anisotropy. We focused 
      on the single-nucleotide polymorphism with the largest individual effects, CETP 
      (rs5882), and found that increased G-allele dosage was associated with higher 
      fractional anisotropy and lower radial and mean diffusivities in voxel-wise analyses 
      of the whole brain. A follow-up analysis detected white matter associations with 
      rs5882 in the opposite direction in 78 older individuals (74.3 ± 7.3 years). 
      Cholesterol levels may influence white matter integrity, and cholesterol-related 
      genes may exert age-dependent effects on the brain.

TI  - Glial vascular degeneration in CADASIL.
PG  - 1393-402
AB  - CADASIL is a genetic vascular dementia caused by mutations in the Notch 3 gene on 
      Chromosome 19. However, little is known about the mechanisms of vascular 
      degeneration. We characterized upstream components of Notch signaling pathways that 
      may be disrupted in CADASIL, by measuring expression of insulin, IGF-1, and IGF-2 
      receptors, Notch 1, Notch 3, and aspartyl-(asparaginyl)-β-hydroxylase (AAH) in 
      cortex and white matter from 3 CADASIL and 6 control brains. We assessed 
      CADASIL-associated cell loss by measuring mRNA corresponding to neurons, 
      oligodendroglia, and astrocytes, and indices of vascular degeneration by measuring 
      smooth muscle actin (SMA) and endothelin-1 expression in isolated vessels. 
      Immunohistochemical staining was used to assess SMA degeneration. Significant 
      abnormalities, including reduced cerebral white matter mRNA levels of Notch 1, Notch 
      3, AAH, SMA, IGF receptors, myelin-associated glycoproteins, and glial fibrillary 
      acidic protein, and reduced vascular expression of SMA, IGF receptors, Notch 1, and 
      Notch 3 were detected in CADASIL-lesioned brains. In addition, we found 
      CADASIL-associated reductions in SMA, and increases in ubiquitin immunoreactivity in 
      the media of white matter and meningeal vessels. No abnormalities in gene expression 
      or immunoreactivity were observed in CADASIL cerebral cortex. In conclusion, 
      molecular abnormalities in CADASIL are largely restricted to white matter and white 
      matter vessels, corresponding to the distribution of neuropathological lesions. 
      These preliminary findings suggest that CADASIL is mediated by both glial and 
      vascular degeneration with reduced expression of IGF receptors and AAH, which 
      regulate Notch expression and function.

TI  - Oligodendroglial response in the spinal cord in TDP-43 proteinopathy with motor 
      neuron involvement.
PG  - 117-24
LID - 10.1159/000362929 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: TDP-43 proteinopathies represent a spectrum of neurodegenerative 
      disorders. Variable clinical presentations including frontotemporal dementia, 
      amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and mixed forms are associated with the spatial 
      heterogeneity of the TDP-43 pathology. Recent studies have emphasized the role of 
      oligodendrocytes in the pathogenesis of ALS. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether TDP-43 
      proteinopathies are associated with an oligodendroglial response. METHODS: We 
      performed a study on 7 controls and 10 diseased patients with spinal cord 
      involvement. Using the oligodendroglia-specific antibody TPPP/p25, we assessed 
      oligodendrocyte density in the lateral corticospinal tracts (LCSs) along with the 
      presence of perineuronal oligodendrocytes (PNOGs) in the anterior horns. We 
      performed a densitometry of myelin basic protein (MBP) immunoreactivity. The numbers 
      of TDP-43 and p62 immunoreactive inclusions were counted in both the LCSs and the 
      anterior horns. RESULTS: Double immunolabeling confirmed that oligodendrocytes 
      harbor TDP-43 inclusions. In the LCSs, MBP density, but not the number of 
      oligodendrocytes, was decreased in the diseased group. However, oligodendrocyte 
      counts in the LCS correlated positively, and the density of MBP inversely, with the 
      number of neuronal inclusions in the anterior horn, suggestive of a compensatory 
      response of oligodendrocytes. The number of neurons with PNOGs correlated with the 
      amount of inclusions. CONCLUSION: Our study further emphasizes the importance of 
      oligodendroglia in the pathogenesis of TDP-43 proteinopathies with spinal cord 
      involvement.

PG  - 491-504
LID - 10.1517/14728222.12.4.491 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Overexpression of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters is a major 
      adaptive advantage used by tumor cells to evade the accumulation of cytotoxic 
      agents. ABCA2, a transporter highly expressed in the cells of the nervous and 
      haematopoetic systems, is associated with lipid transport and drug resistance in 
      cancer cells, including tumor stem cells. Recently, a single nucleotide polymorphism 
      (SNP) in Abca2 was linked to early onset Alzheimer's disease (AD). The 
      characterization of two independent knockout mouse models has shed light on putative 
      in vivo functions of this transporter in the development and maintenance of myelin 
      membrane lipids in the CNS. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this review is to guide the 
      reader through the existing scope of literature on the ABCA2 transporter, focusing 
      on its potential as a future target in human pathologies, specifically cancer and 
      neurological disease. METHODS: An NCBI PubMed literature search was conducted to 
      address the growing body of ABCA2 literature that, at the time of publication, 
      included 39 reports. From these, we focused on papers that provided insight into the 
      functional importance of this transporter in tumor stem cells, cancer, drug 
      resistance, Alzheimer's disease and myelination. RESULTS/CONCLUSION: These studies 
      have implicated ABCA2 as a therapeutic target in modulating the drug resistance 
      phenotype prevalent in human cancers and in the treatment of neuropathies, including 
      Alzheimer's disease and myelin-related disorders.

TI  - Role of immune activation and cytokine expression in HIV-1-associated neurologic 
      diseases.
PG  - 335-58
AB  - Central nervous system (CNS) involvement is common during human immunodeficiency 
      virus type-1 (HIV-1) infection. The neurologic disease of the CNS most frequently 
      observed during acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) is HIV-1-associated 
      cognitive/motor complex or AIDS dementia complex (ADC), which is most likely a 
      direct consequence of HIV-1 infection of the CNS. The peripheral nervous system 
      (PNS) is also affected in HIV-1-infected individuals and there are several features 
      of immune- and cytokine-related pathogenesis in both the CNS and PNS that are 
      reviewed. Several lines of evidence demonstrate aspects of immune activation in the 
      CNS and peripheral nervous system (PNS) of HIV-1-infected individuals. The relative 
      paucity of HIV-1 expression in contrast to widespread functional and pathologic 
      changes in the CNS and PNS of AIDS patients, and the lack of evidence of productive 
      infection of HIV-1 in neuronal cells in vivo lead to the possibility of indirect or 
      immunopathogenic mechanisms for HIV-1-related neurologic diseases. Proposed 
      mechanisms of neuronal and glial cell damage are injury of oligodendrocytes by tumor 
      necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) released from activated macrophage/microglia, 
      calcium-dependent excitoneurotoxicity induced by gp120 HIV-1 envelope protein, 
      N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-mediated neurotoxicity by quinolinic acid (a 
      product of activated macrophages), cell injury by HIV-1-specific cytotoxic T cells, 
      and apoptosis of oligodendrocytes or neurons triggered by interaction between cell 
      surface receptors and HIV-1 gp120 protein. Common to those mechanisms is the 
      dependence on cellular activation with expression of proinflammatory cytokines 
      (TNF-alpha, interleukin-1). Amplification of activation signals through the cytokine 
      network by macrophage/astrocyte/endothelial cell interactions, and cell-to-cell 
      contact between activated macrophages and neural cells by upregulation of adhesion 
      molecules dramatically enhances the toxic effect of macrophage products. Expression 
      of immunosuppressive cytokines such as interleukin-4, interleukin-6, and 
      transforming growth factor-beta is also increased in the CNS and PNS of 
      HIV-1-infected patients. This may serve as neuroprotective and regenerative 
      mechanism against insults to nervous system tissue.

TI  - Structural and molecular myelination deficits occur prior to neuronal loss in the 
      YAC128 and BACHD models of Huntington disease.
PG  - 2621-2632
AB  - White matter (WM) atrophy is a significant feature of Huntington disease (HD), 
      although its aetiology and early pathological manifestations remain poorly defined. 
      In this study, we aimed to characterize WM-related features in the transgenic YAC128 
      and BACHD models of HD. Using diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging (DT-MRI), 
      we demonstrate that microstructural WM abnormalities occur from an early age in 
      YAC128 mice. Similarly, electron microscopy analysis of myelinated fibres of the 
      corpus callosum indicated that myelin sheaths are thinner in YAC128 mice as early as 
      1.5 months of age, well before any neuronal loss can be detected. Transcript levels 
      of myelin-related genes in striatal and cortical tissues were significantly lower in 
      YAC128 mice from 2 weeks of age, and these findings were replicated in 
      differentiated primary oligodendrocytes from YAC128 mice, suggesting a possible 
      mechanistic explanation for the observed structural deficits. Concordant with these 
      observations, we demonstrate reduced expression of myelin-related genes at 3 months 
      of age and WM microstructural abnormalities using DT-MRI at 12 months of age in the 
      BACHD rats. These findings indicate that WM deficits in HD are an early phenotype 
      associated with cell-intrinsic effects of mutant huntingtin on myelin-related 
      transcripts in oligodendrocytes, and raise the possibility that WM abnormalities may 
      be an early contributing factor to the pathogenesis of HD.

LID - 10.1038/nri2565 [doi]
AB  - Microglial cells are the main innate immune cells of the complex cellular structure 
      of the brain. These cells respond quickly to pathogens and injury, accumulate in 
      regions of degeneration and produce a wide variety of pro-inflammatory molecules. 
      These observations have resulted in active debate regarding the exact role of 
      microglial cells in the brain and whether they have beneficial or detrimental 
      functions. Careful targeting of these cells could have therapeutic benefits for 
      several types of trauma and disease specific to the central nervous system. This 
      Review discusses the molecular details underlying the innate immune response in the 
      brain during infection, injury and disease.

PG  - 409-14
AB  - Two mildly demented patients with emotional disorder presented massive cortical 
      argyrophilic grains (ArG) in the limbic area and coiled bodies mainly in the white 
      matter. Immunohistochemically, the ArG consisted of partially ubiquitinated 
      full-length phosphorylated tau. A modified Gallyas-Braak method, used after 
      potassium permanganate and oxalic acid pretreatment, revealed many filiform, knobby 
      or pleomorphic spine-like appendages on the ArG. Double immunohistochemical staining 
      using anti-tau with either anti-microtubule-associated protein 2 or 
      anti-neurofilament 200K revealed that ArG were intimately associated with dendrites 
      rather than with axons. Electron microscopic studies with tau immunohistochemistry 
      and the Gallyas-Braak method revealed that the ArG were composed of bundles of 
      smooth tubules of 25-nm diameter. The coiled body-bearing cells had the 
      morphological characteristic of oligodendroglia. These results indicate that the 
      presence of ArG is a cytoskeletal abnormality affecting predominantly the 
      dendrospinal portions of neurons. A survey of diseases with cytoskeletal disorders 
      revealed that a small number of similar argyrophilic granular structures are 
      sometimes observed in progressive supranuclear palsy, Pick's disease with Pick 
      bodies and corticobasal degeneration. Dementia with ArG is thought to be a unique 
      cytoskeletal abnormality associated predominantly with the dendrospinal portions of 
      neurons and oligodendroglia.

TI  - The cell survival kinase SGK1 and its targets FOXO3a and NDRG1 in aged human brain.
PG  - 623-33
LID - 10.1111/nan.12023 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: Serum- and glucocorticoid-inducible kinase 1 (SGK1) protects neuronal cells 
      from injury stimuli in vitro, and exerts anti-apoptotic effects via downstream 
      targets including the forkhead-like transcription factor FOXO3a. SGK1 is a homolog 
      of Akt, a related survival kinase that is up-regulated in Alzheimer's disease (AD). 
      Here we aimed to examine the expression pattern of SGK1 and FOXO3a in aged human 
      cerebral cortex. METHODS: Cortical tissue from aged donors without brain disease 
      (aged controls, AC, n = 19) and from severe AD patients (Braak stage V-VI; n = 14) 
      were examined by immunohistochemistry and immunoblot analysis. RESULTS: SGK1 was 
      present in all samples (detected by immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting). Large 
      cortical neuronal cells were strongly positive for SGK1, with predominantly nuclear 
      labelling. Some astrocytes and oligodendrocytes were also labelled. SGK1 was not 
      seen in nerve tracts (axons or myelin) and rarely seen in CD68-positive cells 
      (microglia, perivascular macrophages) or vascular cells (myocytes or endothelia). 
      The fraction of large cortical neurones with nuclear FOXO3a was lower in AD cases 
      relative to AC (54%, 70%, respectively, P < 0.001). In immunoblots no difference in 
      SGK1 abundance was detected between AC and AD tissues. Phosphorylation of NDRG1 (an 
      SGK1-specific target) was greater in AD, relative to AC cases (approximately 
      twofold, P = 0.023). CONCLUSIONS: Neuronal expression of SGK1 in aged human brain 
      and its nuclear compartmentalization suggest a possible neuroprotective role. FOXO3a 
      and NDRG1 data suggest augmented SGK1 activity (as reported for Akt) in severe AD. 
      Increased intracellular SGK1 may complement enhanced Akt, with a distinct 
      subcellular localization.

      disorder: a cross-sectional cohort study.
PG  - 79
LID - 10.1186/1742-2094-7-79 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Neuroinflammation and demyelination have been suggested as mechanisms 
      causing HIV-1 associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND). This cross-sectional cohort 
      study explores the potential role of antibodies to myelin oligodendrocyte 
      glycoprotein (MOG), a putative autoantigen in multiple sclerosis, in the 
      pathogenesis of HAND. METHODS: IgG antibodies against MOG were measured by ELISA in 
      sera and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of 65 HIV-positive patients with HAND (n = 14), 
      cerebral opportunistic infections (HIVOI, n = 25), primary HIV infection (HIVM, n = 
      5) and asymptomatic patients (HIVasy, n = 21). As control group HIV-negative 
      patients with bacterial or viral CNS infections (OIND, n = 18) and other 
      neurological diseases (OND, n = 22) were included. In a subset of HAND patients MOG 
      antibodies were determined before and during antiviral therapy. RESULTS: In serum, 
      significantly higher MOG antibody titers were observed in HAND compared to OND 
      patients. In CSF, significantly higher antibody titers were observed in HAND and 
      HIVOI patients compared to HIVasy and OND patients and in OIND compared to OND 
      patients. CSF anti-MOG antibodies showed a high sensitivity and specificity (85.7% 
      and 76.2%) for discriminating patients with active HAND from asymptomatic HIV 
      patients. MOG immunopositive HAND patients performed significantly worse on the HIV 
      dementia scale and showed higher viral load in CSF. In longitudinally studied HAND 
      patients, sustained antibody response was noted despite successful clearance of 
      viral RNA. CONCLUSIONS: Persistence of MOG antibodies despite viral clearance in a 
      high percentage of HAND patients suggests ongoing neuroinflammation, possibly 
      preventing recovery from HAND.

PG  - 89-97
AB  - Cerebrovascular diseases can causes cognitive impairment and dementia by loss of 
      neurons and synaptic connections, destruction of axons, and demyelinization. 
      Biological markers including genetic tests, brain imaging techniques, and 
      biochemical assays in the CSF are valuable for the identification and quantification 
      of cerebrovascular diseases. Genetic tests may be used to detect mutations that 
      cause hereditary cerebral amyloid angiopathies or cerebral autosomal dominant 
      arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL). Structural 
      CT and MR imaging is routinely used to visualize and quantify infarcts and 
      white-matter changes. Functional SPET and PET imaging can demonstrate focal and 
      remote effects of vascular lesions on cerebral blood flow and metabolism. 
      Biochemical imaging using proton MRS is a nonspecific marker for neuronal and axonal 
      damage. Among biochemical markers in the CSF, tau protein, phospho-tau, and beta 
      amyloid protein are helpful to differentiate vascular dementia from Alzheimer's 
      disease.

TI  - TGF-beta in the central nervous system: potential roles in ischemic injury and 
      neurodegenerative diseases.
PG  - 267-92
AB  - The Transforming Growth Factor-betas (TGF-beta) are a group of multifunctional 
      proteins whose cellular sites of production and action are widely distributed 
      throughout the body, including the central nervous system (CNS). Within the CNS, 
      various isoforms of TGF-beta are produced by both glial and neural cells. When 
      evaluated in either cell culture or in vivo models, the various isoforms of TGF-beta 
      have been shown to have potent effects on the proliferation, function, or survival 
      of both neurons and all three glial cell types, astrocytes, microglia and 
      oligodendrocytes. TGF-beta has also been shown to play a role in several forms of 
      acute CNS pathology including ischemia, excitotoxicity and several forms of 
      neurodegenerative diseases including multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, AIDS 
      dementia and Alzheimer's disease.

TI  - Alterations of annexin expression in pathological neuronal and glial reactions. 
      Immunohistochemical localization of annexins I, II (p36 and p11 subunits), IV, and 
      VI in the human hippocampus.
PG  - 640-9
AB  - Annexins are Ca(2+)-dependent membrane-binding proteins that are potentially 
      important in Ca(2+)-induced neurotoxicity or neuroprotection. To address the 
      possible involvement of annexins in cellular reactions to brain injury and 
      neurodegenerative disease, we studied the immunohistochemical localization of 
      annexins I, II (p36 and p11), IV, and VI in the adult human hippocampus. 
      Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue from autopsy cases representing 
      hypoxic-ischemic injury, seizure disorders, Alzheimer's disease, and age-related 
      controls were examined. Neurons showed cytoplasmic immunoreactivity for annexin I, 
      whereas annexin VI was distributed in patterns suggesting plasma membrane and 
      perisynaptic locations. The cytoarchitectural distribution of annexin VI within 
      neurons was altered in pathological states and annexin VI was strongly associated 
      with neuronal granulovacuolar bodies in Alzheimer's disease. Reactive astrocytes 
      expressed annexins I, II (p36 and p11), and IV, whereas quiescent astrocytes were 
      minimally immunoreactive. Significant annexin immunoreactivity was also detected in 
      oligodendrocytes (annexin IV), ependymocytes (I, II, and IV), choroid plexus (I, IV, 
      and VI), meningothelium (I, II, IV, and VI), and vascular endothelium (II and IV) 
      and smooth muscle (I, IV, and VI). This is the first comparative study of 
      immunoreactivities for multiple annexins in human brain. Neurons and glia display 
      selective and different profiles of annexin protein expression and show 
      immunohistochemical changes in pathological conditions, which suggest involvement of 
      annexins in neuronal and glial reactions to injury.

TI  - Running Exercise Reduces Myelinated Fiber Loss in the Dentate Gyrus of the 
      Hippocampus in APP/PS1 Transgenic Mice.
PG  - 377-83
AB  - To investigate the effect of running exercise on myelinated fibers in the dentate 
      gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus during Alzheimer's disease (AD), 6-month-old male 
      APP/PS1 transgenic mice were randomly assigned to control or running groups. The 
      running group mice were subjected to a running protocol for four months. The 
      behaviors of the mice from both group mice were then assessed using the Morris water 
      maze, and the total volume of the DG and the related quantitative parameters with 
      characteristics of the myelinated nerve fiber and the myelin sheath in the DG were 
      investigated using unbiased stereological techniques and electron microscopy. 
      Learning and spatial memory performances were both significantly increased in the 
      running group compared with the control group. There was no significant difference 
      in the gratio of the myelinated axons between the two groups. However, the DG 
      volume, the myelinated fiber length and volume in the DG, and the myelin sheath 
      volume and thickness in the DG were all significantly increased in the running group 
      mice compared with the control group mice. These results indicated that running 
      exercise was able to prevent DG atrophy and delay the progression of the myelinated 
      fiber loss and the demyelination of the myelin sheaths in the DG in an AD mouse 
      model, which may underlie the running-induced improvement in learning and spatial 
      memory. Taken together, these results demonstrated that running exercise could delay 
      the progression of AD.

AB  - Biochemical and neuropathological studies of brains from individuals with Alzheimer 
      disease (AD) provide clear evidence for an activation of inflammatory pathways, and 
      long-term use of anti-inflammatory drugs is linked with reduced risk to develop the 
      disease. As cause and effect relationships between inflammation and AD are being 
      worked out, there is a realization that some components of this complex molecular 
      and cellular machinery are most likely promoting pathological processes leading to 
      AD, whereas other components serve to do the opposite. The challenge will be to find 
      ways of fine tuning inflammation to delay, prevent, or treat AD.

LID - 10.1097/NEN.0000000000000180 [doi]
AB  - A familial behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia associated with 
      astrocyte-predominant tauopathy is described in 2 sisters born from consanguineous 
      parents. The neuropathologic examination revealed massive accumulation of abnormally 
      hyperphosphorylated, conformational, truncated tau at aspartic acid 421, 
      ubiquitinated and nitrated tau at Tyr29 in cortical astrocyte (including their 
      perivascular foot processes), and Bergmann glia. Smaller amounts of abnormal tau 
      were observed in neurons and rarely in oligodendrocytes. There was decreased 
      expression of glial glutamate transporter in the majority of tau-positive 
      astrocytes. Gel electrophoresis of sarkosyl-insoluble fractions showed 2 bands of 64 
      and 60 kDa and a doublet of 67 to 70 kDa (which are different from those seen in 
      Alzheimer disease and in typical 4R and 3R tauopathies) together with several bands 
      of lower molecular weight indicative of truncated tau. Analysis of the expression of 
      MAPT isoforms further revealed altered splicing and representation of tau isoforms 
      involving exons 2, 3, and 10. Genetic testing revealed no known mutations in PSEN1, 
      PSEN2, APP, MAPT, GRN, FUS, and TARDBP and no pathologic expansion in C9ORF72. 
      However, a novel rare heterozygous sequence variant(p.Q140H) of uncertain 
      significance was identified in FUS in both siblings.

TI  - Cytokine circuits in brain. Implications for AIDS dementia complex.
PG  - 71-88
AB  - This chapter has summarized studies showing that cells of the immune system and 
      glial cells of the CNS use many of the same cytokines as communication signals. 
      Activated astrocytes and microglia are the principal sources of these cytokines in 
      the CNS, although oligodendrocytes are capable of expressing IL-1 and TGF-beta. 
      There is a complex circuitry of interactions mediated by cytokines, especially in 
      the event of blood-brain barrier damage and lymphoid/mononuclear cell infiltration 
      into the CNS. Infiltrating activated macrophages produce cytokines such as IL-1, 
      TNF-alpha, and IL-6, which would trigger glial cells to produce their own cytokines. 
      The activation of astrocytes and microglia to secrete proinflammatory cytokines such 
      as IL-1, TNF-alpha, IL-6, and GM-CsF may contribute to the propagation of 
      intracerebral immune and inflammatory responses initiated by immune cells, as well 
      as enhancement of HIV-1 expression in the CNS. The cytokine cascades ongoing in the 
      CNS could ultimately be suppressed due to the presence of immunosuppressive 
      cytokines such as TGF-beta. Whether immune and inflammatory responses within the CNS 
      are propagated or suppressed depends on a number of parameters, including (a) the 
      activational status of these cells, (b) cytokine receptor levels on glial and immune 
      cells, (c) the presence of cytokines with both immune-enhancing and 
      immune-suppressing effects (IFN-gamma, IL-1, TNF-alpha, IL-6, TGF-beta, CsFs), (d) 
      the concentration and location of these cytokines in the CNS, and (e) the temporal 
      sequence in which a particular cell is exposed to numerous cytokines (see Fig. 1). 
      The ultimate outcome of immunologic and inflammatory events in the CNS, as well as 
      HIV expression, will be determined, in part, by an interplay of the above 
      parameters.

AB  - Regenerative responses, including re-expression of developmentally regulated 
      proteins, occur in Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain and in beta-amyloid 
      (Abeta)-treated neuronal cultures. Brain microenvironment might also be altered by 
      Abeta or by unknown materials in AD brain to make neurons or progenitor cells 
      regenerative. However, these responses and alterations might not be sufficient to 
      replace neuronal loss, but rather might act as an effecter of cell death. For 
      instance, downregulation of growth inhibitory factor/metallothionein-III and 
      upregulation of MAP1B result in both neurite sprouting and neuronal death. The 
      deteriorative regulation of Mash1 and Olig2 by Abeta also leads to differentiation 
      and death of progenitor cells. Clarifying the cell death mechanism accompanied with 
      regenerative responses might be necessary for repairing the nervous system or 
      slowing disease progression in AD.

PG  - 174-83
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Chronic inflammation with microglia activation is thought to play a major 
      role in the formation or clearance of Alzheimer's disease (AD) lesions, as well as 
      in the induction of demyelination in multiple sclerosis (MS). In MS, the cortex is 
      severely affected by chronic, long-lasting inflammation, microglia activation, and 
      demyelination. To what extent chronic inflammation in the cortex of MS patients 
      influences the development of AD lesions is so far unresolved. METHODS: The study 
      was performed on autopsy tissue of 45 MS cases, 9 AD cases, and 15 control subjects. 
      We analyzed lymphocyte and plasma cell infiltration in relation to microglia 
      activation, to the presence of beta-amyloid plaques and (AT8+) neurofibrillary 
      tangles, and to myelin pathology. RESULTS: Profound microglia activation, determined 
      by a broad spectrum of markers, was found in both MS and AD cortices, and the 
      patterns of microglia activation were closely similar. Microglia activation in MS 
      cortex, in contrast with that in AD and control cortex, correlated with lymphocyte 
      and plasma-cell infiltrates in the meninges. MS cases older than 64 years 
      experienced development of AD pathology in comparable incidence as seen in the 
      course of normal aging. The density of beta-amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary 
      tangles did not differ between demyelinated and nondemyelinated cortical areas. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that microglia activation in the MS cortex alone has 
      little or no influence on the development of cortical AD pathology.

TI  - Up-regulation of MAP2e-expressing oligodendrocytes in the white matter of patients 
      with HIV-1 encephalitis.
PG  - 480-8
AB  - HIV-1 encephalitis (HIVE) is characterized by infection of macrophages and 
      microglial cells, diffuse gliosis, and damage to neuronal populations. The nature of 
      the white matter damage in HIVE remains elusive, and little is known about the 
      status of the oligodendrocyte in HIVE. We have recently described a novel isoform of 
      microtubule-associated protein-2 (MAP2e), which is expressed transiently in 
      developing oligodendrocytes during myelination, and in remyelinating 
      oligodendrocytes in multiple sclerosis lesions. In this study, we tested the 
      hypothesis that MAP2e expression would be increased in the white matter of HIVE. We 
      analysed brain sections from patients with HIVE and controls (HIV+ and HIV-) by 
      immunocytochemistry and found that MAP2e+ cells are significantly increased in HIVE 
      (range, 5-167 cells per cm2) compared to controls (range, 1-25 cells per cm2). 
      MAP2e+ cells were negative for GFAP, CD68, LN3, RCA-1, von Willebrand factor and 
      HIV-1 p24, but positive for MBP or Luxol-Fast Blue, supporting their 
      oligodendroglial lineage. A topographical association between MAP2e and HIV-1 p24 
      expression was noted, but not between MAP2e and beta-APP, a marker of damaged axons. 
      Our results demonstrate that MAP2e can serve as a marker of white matter damage in 
      HIVE and support the notion that oligodendrocyte damage/repair occurs during HIV-1 
      infection.

AB  - Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) is involved in regulation of fatty acid metabolism, and 
      facilitates cellular uptake of lipoproteins, lipids and lipid-soluble vitamins. We 
      evaluated LPL distribution in healthy and Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain tissue and 
      its relative levels in cerebrospinal fluid. LPL immunostaining is widely present in 
      different neuronal subgroups, microglia, astrocytes and oligodendroglia throughout 
      cerebrum, cerebellum and spinal cord. LPL immunoreactivity is also present in 
      leptomeninges, small blood vessels, choroid plexus and ependymal cells, Schwann 
      cells associated with cranial nerves, and in anterior and posterior pituitary. In 
      vitro studies have shown presence of secreted LPL in conditioned media of human 
      cortical neuronal cell line (HCN2) and neuroblastoma cells (SK-N-SH), but not in 
      media of cultured primary human astrocytes. LPL was present in cytoplasmic and 
      nuclear fractions of neuronal cells and astrocytes in vitro. LPL immunoreactivity 
      strongly associates with AD-related pathology, staining diffuse plaques, dystrophic 
      and swollen neurites, possible Hirano bodies and activated glial cells. We observed 
      no staining associated with neurofibrillary tangles or granulovacuolar degeneration. 
      Granule cells of the dentate gyrus and the associated synaptic network showed 
      significantly reduced staining in AD compared to control tissue. LPL was also 
      reduced in AD CSF samples relative to those in controls.

TI  - Myeloid microvesicles in cerebrospinal fluid are associated with myelin damage and 
      neuronal loss in mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer disease.
PG  - 813-25
LID - 10.1002/ana.24235 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: We have described cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) myeloid microvesicles (MVs) 
      as a marker of microglia activation during neuroinflammation in Alzheimer disease 
      (AD), and characterized their ability to produce toxic amyloid β1-42 (Aβ1-42 ) 
      oligomers from aggregated or soluble substrate. The aim of this study is to 
      investigate the association of CSF myeloid MVs with neuroimaging, clinical, and 
      paraclinical data in AD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). METHODS: We collected 
      CSF from 106 AD patients, 51 MCI patients, and 29 neurologically healthy controls. 
      We examined CSF myeloid MV content and AD markers. A subgroup of 34 AD and 21 MCI 
      patients underwent structural and diffusion tensor MRI. RESULTS: Higher levels of 
      myeloid MVs were found in the CSF of AD patients and MCI patients converting within 
      3 years relative to controls, but also, at a lower level, in MCI patients not 
      converting to AD. CSF myeloid MVs were associated with Tau but not with Aβ1-42 CSF 
      levels. CSF MVs levels correlated with white matter (WM) tract damage in MCI, and 
      with hippocampal atrophy in AD. INTERPRETATION: Microglial MVs are neurotoxic and 
      myelinotoxic in the presence of Aβ1-42 . CSF myeloid MVs, mirroring microglia 
      activation and MV release, are associated with WM damage in MCI and hippocampal 
      atrophy in AD. This suggests that hippocampal microglia activation, in the presence 
      of Aβ1-42 in excess, produces neurotoxic and oligodendrotoxic oligomers that, 
      through WM tract damage, spread disease to neighboring and connected areas, causing 
      local microglia activation and propagation of disease through the same sequence of 
      events. Ann Neurol 2014;76:813-825.

TI  - LRRK2 expression in normal and pathologic human brain and in human cell lines.
PG  - 953-63
AB  - Mutations in the leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 gene (LRRK2) have been recently 
      identified in families with autosomal-dominant late-onset Parkinson disease. We 
      report that by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, the mRNA of LRRK2 is 
      expressed in soluble extracts of human brain, liver, and heart and in cultured human 
      astrocytes, microglia, and oligodendroglia as well as in human neuroblastoma cell 
      lines. We find by Western blotting using a polyclonal antibody of the leucine-rich 
      repeat kinase 2 protein (Lrrk2) specific for C-terminal residues 2,511-2,527 that an 
      apparent full-length protein and several of its fractions are expressed in soluble 
      extracts of normal human brain. By immunocytochemistry, the antibody recognizes 
      neurons, and more weakly astrocytes and microglia, in normal brain tissue. It 
      intensely labels Lewy bodies in Parkinson disease and related neurodegenerative 
      disorders. It also labels a subset of neurofibrillary tangles in Alzheimer disease 
      and the Parkinsonism dementia complex of Guam (PDCG). It labels thorn-shaped 
      astrocytes and oligodendroglial coiled bodies in PDCG; oligodendroglial inclusions 
      in multiple system atrophy; Pick bodies in Pick disease; nuclear and cytoplasmic 
      inclusions in Huntington disease; and intraneuronal and glial inclusions in 
      amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. In summary, LRRK2 is constitutively expressed in 
      neurons and also in glial cells of human brain. It strongly associates with 
      pathological inclusions in several neurodegenerative disorders.

TI  - Accumulation of multiple neurodegenerative disease-related proteins in familial 
      frontotemporal lobar degeneration associated with granulin mutation.
PG  - 1513

AB  - In 2006, mutations in the granulin gene were identified in patients with familial 
      Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration. Granulin transcript haploinsufficiency has been 
      proposed as a disease mechanism that leads to the loss of functional progranulin 
      protein. Granulin mutations were initially found in tau-negative patients, though 
      recent findings indicate that these mutations are associated with other 
      neurodegenerative disorders with tau pathology, including Alzheimer's disease and 
      corticobasal degeneration. Moreover, a reduction in progranulin in tau transgenic 
      mice is associated with increasing tau accumulation. To investigate the influence of 
      a decline in progranulin protein on other forms of neurodegenerative-related protein 
      accumulation, human granulin mutation cases were investigated by histochemical and 
      biochemical analyses. Results showed a neuronal and glial tau accumulation in 
      granulin mutation cases. Tau staining revealed neuronal pretangle forms and glial 
      tau in both astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. Furthermore, phosphorylated 
      α-synuclein-positive structures were also found in oligodendrocytes and the 
      neuropil. Immunoblot analysis of fresh frozen brain tissues revealed that tau was 
      present in the sarkosyl-insoluble fraction, and composed of three- and four-repeat 
      tau isoforms, resembling Alzheimer's disease. Our data suggest that progranulin 
      reduction might be the cause of multiple proteinopathies due to the accelerating 
      accumulation of abnormal proteins including TDP-43 proteinopathy, tauopathy and 
      α-synucleinopathy.

AB  - The neurologic disease most frequently seen during acquired immunodeficiency 
      syndrome (AIDS) is AIDS dementia complex (ADC) or HIV encephalopathy, which is a 
      direct consequence of HIV-1 infection of the central nervous system (CNS). A limited 
      expression of HIV-1 in CNS and peripheral nervous system (PNS) tissue of AIDS 
      patients in contrast to widespread functional and pathologic abnormalities suggests 
      indirect or immunopathogenetic mechanisms of ADC and HIV-1-associated predominantly 
      sensory neuropathy. Proposed mechanisms include injury of oligodendrocytes by tumor 
      necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) released from macrophages, calcium dependent 
      excitoneurotoxicity induced by gp120 HIV-1 envelope protein, N-methyl-D-aspartate 
      (NMDA) receptor-mediated neurotoxicity by quinolinic acid, cell injury by 
      HIV-1-specific cytotoxic T cells, and apoptosis of oligodendrocytes or neurons. The 
      amplification of cellular activation by cytokine network and cell-to-cell contact 
      between activated macrophages and neural cells by upregulation of adhesion molecules 
      dramatically enhance toxic effect of macrophage products.

TI  - Microvascular changes in the white mater in dementia.
PG  - 28-31
LID - 10.1016/j.jns.2009.02.328 [doi]
AB  - Our studies of the brain microvascular system have focused on some aspects not 
      commonly studied by other research groups because we use some techniques not often 
      used by others. Our observations tend to add new details to the pathological picture 
      rather than contradict the mainstream findings. We use large, thick celloidin 
      sections which provide a three dimensional view of vascular networks, and alkaline 
      phosphatase (AP) staining which allows one to differentiate between afferent and 
      efferent vessels. We found millions of lipid microemboli in the brains of patients 
      after cardiac surgery, and concluded that they caused vascular dementia in many 
      patients. We previously proposed an animal model of vascular dementia using brain 
      irradiation, which induces capillary loss. Lipid emboli might also be used to create 
      an animal model of vascular dementia. The deep white matter is vulnerable to chronic 
      hypoperfusion because the blood vessels supplying this region arise from the 
      border-zone and have the longest course of all vessels penetrating the cerebrum. In 
      cases with leukoaraiosis (LA), we found periventricular venous collagenosis (PVC), 
      resulting in stenosis. Thirteen of 20 subjects older than 60 years had PVC, and 10 
      of 13 subjects with severe PVC had LA. Vascular stenosis might induce chronic 
      ischemia and/or edema in the deep white matter, leading to LA. We suggest three 
      mechanisms for a possible genetic predisposition to PVC: i) a predisposition to 
      excessive venous collagenosis; ii) an indirect effect that causes chronic 
      periventricular ischemia with a reactive over-production of collagen; and iii) 
      mechanical damage to small vessels due to increased pulsatile motion. We found 
      tortuous arterioles supplying the deep white matter beginning at about age 50. We 
      also found a trend toward an increase in tortuosity in LA. If tortuosity is a factor 
      in LA, it is probably significant in only a subset of cases. String vessels, 
      remnants of capillaries, occur commonly in the brain, and are increased in ischemia, 
      AD, and irradiation. Capillary injury or shutdown of blood flow can lead to 
      capillary loss and string vessel formation. We found string vessels in brains from 
      preterm babies to the very old. They seem to disappear after some months or years. 
      We found an early loss of capillaries in LA, followed in a few years by the 
      disappearance of string vessels. LA lesions do not progress to cortical cavitating 
      lesions. Our findings raise three questions. 1. Why is the capillary loss arrested 
      before infarction? 2. Why is there a floor below which the vascular density will not 
      fall? 3. Why does the process which initiates string vessels shut down? We explain 
      the vascular changes in LA as follows. LA induces apoptosis with loss of 
      oligodendrocytes. Capillaries and neuropil are lost. Increased oxygen extraction 
      from the blood in the deep white matter in LA implies that there are too many cells 
      for the remaining capillaries. Thus, the capillaries appear to die first. But why do 
      they stop dying? Perhaps a minimum number of capillaries are needed to transport the 
      arterial blood to the venous system. Once the capillaries stop dying, no more string 
      vessels are formed, and the string vessels gradually disappear.

AB  - Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) represents a cognitive state intermediate between 
      normal aging and early Alzheimer's disease (AD). To investigate if the molecular 
      signature of MCI parallels the clinical picture, we use microarrays to extensively 
      profile gene expression in 4 cortical brain regions (entorhinal cortex, hippocampus, 
      superior frontal gyrus, post-central gyrus) using the postmortem tissue from 
      cognitively normal aged controls, MCI, and AD cases. Our data reveal that gene 
      expression patterns in MCI are not an extension of aging, and for the most part, are 
      not intermediate between aged controls and AD. Functional enrichment analysis of 
      significant genes revealed prominent upregulation in MCI brains of genes associated 
      with anabolic and biosynthetic pathways (notably transcription, protein 
      biosynthesis, protein trafficking, and turnover) as well as mitochondrial energy 
      generation. In addition, many synaptic genes showed altered expression in MCI, 
      predominantly upregulation, including genes for central components of the vesicle 
      fusion machinery at the synapse, synaptic vesicle trafficking, neurotransmitter 
      receptors, and synaptic structure and stabilization. These data suggest that there 
      is a rebalancing of synaptic transmission in the MCI brain. To investigate if 
      synaptic gene expression levels in MCI were related to cognitive function, Pearson 
      correlation coefficient between the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) and 
      region-specific messenger RNA expression were computed for MCI cases. A number of 
      synaptic genes showed strong significant correlations (r > 0.8, p < 0.01) most 
      notably in the entorhinal cortex, with fewer in the hippocampus, and very few in 
      neocortical regions. The synaptic genes with highly significant correlations were 
      predominantly related to synaptic transmission and plasticity, and myelin 
      composition. Unexpectedly, we found that gene expression changes that facilitate 
      synaptic excitability and plasticity were overwhelmingly associated with poorer 
      MMSE, and conversely that gene expression changes that inhibit plasticity were 
      positively associated with MMSE. These data suggest that there are excessive 
      excitability and apparent plasticity in limbic brain regions in MCI, that is 
      associated with impaired synaptic and cognitive function. Such changes would be 
      predicted to contribute to increased excitability, in turn leading to greater 
      metabolic demand and ultimately progressive degeneration and AD, if not controlled.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by the accumulation of amyloid-β (Aβ) and 
      abnormally phosphorylated tau which contribute to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. 
      Previous studies demonstrated that Aβ and a truncated fragment of Aβ induced death 
      of oligodendrocytes in vitro. In addition, a triple-transgenic AD mouse model 
      exhibits significant region-specific alterations in myelination patterns at time 
      points preceding the appearance of Aβ accumulation. The growth arrest and DNA damage 
      protein (GADD) 34 is up-regulated in response to ER stress and regulates subunit of 
      protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) complex that dephosphorylates eukaryotic translation 
      initiator factor 2α (elF2α). Thus, GADD34 is known as an ER stress regulator or ER 
      stress marker. In a recent study, GADD34 was induced in the spinal cord glial cells 
      of an amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) mouse model. It is interesting that 
      reduced GADD34 delayed the onset of ALS and prolonged the survival period in the 
      mouse model. In this study, we have demonstrated that GADD34 was increased in 
      neurons of human AD brains. Additionally, this finding was also observed in 
      oligodendrocytes in human AD brains. Furthermore, we showed that the expression 
      levels of GADD34 in neurons and oligodendrocytes were significantly increased in the 
      early stage of AD in the mouse model. As oligodendrocytes were more affected in the 
      early stages of AD in this experimental model, ER stress of Aβ oligomers may be more 
      related to oligodendrocytes than to neurons. These results suggest that GADD34 could 
      be a therapeutic target for preventing ER stress in neuronal cells in AD.

TI  - The AIDS dementia complex: II. Neuropathology.
PG  - 525-35
AB  - In order to define the histopathological substrate of the dementia that frequently 
      complicates the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), we analyzed the 
      neuropathological findings in 70 autopsied adult AIDS patients, 46 of whom had 
      suffered clinically overt dementia. Less than 10% of the brains were histologically 
      normal. Abnormalities were found predominantly in the white matter and in 
      subcortical structures, with relative sparing of the cortex. Their frequency and 
      severity generally correlated well with the degree and duration of clinical 
      dementia. Most commonly noted was diffuse pallor in the white matter, which in the 
      pathologically milder cases was accompanied by scanty perivascular infiltrates of 
      lymphocytes and brown-pigmented macrophages, and in the most advanced cases by 
      clusters of foamy macrophages and multinucleated cells associated with multifocal 
      rarefaction of the white matter. However, in nearly one third of the demented cases 
      the histopathological findings were remarkably bland in relation to the severity of 
      clinical dysfunction. In addition, similar mild changes were noted in over one half 
      of the nondemented patients, consistent with subclinical involvement. Vacuolar 
      myelopathy was found in 23 patients and was generally more common and severe in 
      patients with advanced brain pathology. Evidence of cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection 
      was noted in nearly one quarter of the brains and was associated with a relative 
      abundance of microglial nodules, but correlated neither with the major subcortical 
      neuropathology nor with the clinical dementia, indicating that CMV infection likely 
      represented a second, superimposed process. This study establishes the AIDS dementia 
      complex as a distinct clinical and pathological entity and, together with 
      accumulating virological evidence, suggests that it is caused by direct LAV/HTLV-III 
      brain infection.

TI  - Pathomechanism of leukoaraiosis: a molecular bridge between the genetic, 
      biochemical, and clinical processes (a mitochondrial hypothesis).
PG  - 21-33
AB  - Ischemic demyelination in the white matter of the brain is a frequent clinical 
      entity. In neuroimaging terms, it is referred to as leukoaraiosis (LA). LA can 
      reflect a broad public health problem, which is caused by a cognitive impairment 
      ranging from mild slowness of thinking to full-blown subcortical dementia. 
      One-quarter of subjects aged 65 yr or over are affected by some degree of white 
      matter changes. There are a number of genetic factors that can be associated with 
      circulatory disturbances of the white matter of the brain. A slight chronic 
      hypoperfusion or an endothelial dysfunction associated with unfavorable genetic 
      variations such as methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase C677T variation and 
      angiotensin-converting enzyme I/D polymorphism then may lead indirectly to a 
      malfunction of the molecular cross-talk between the nucleus and the mitochondria. 
      This results in a decrease in the production of energy in the glia cells and thereby 
      the beginning of demyelination. From another aspect, the presence of either the 
      apolipoprotein E 2 or 4 alleles may cause an increased vulnerability to a slight 
      chronic hypoperfusion of the white matter by reducing the range of mechanical and 
      chemical flexibility of the glial cytoskeleton. In consequence of the chronic 
      hypoperfusion, the functionally damaged kinesin protein gives rise also to the 
      disturbances of the trafficking of the myelin basic protein mRNAs in the 
      oligodendrocytes. On the basis of the current knowledge on LA, this article suggests 
      a hypothetical molecular bridge between the genetic, biochemical, and clinical 
      processes.

TI  - White matter lesions defined by diffusion tensor imaging in older adults.
PG  - 465-76
LID - 10.1002/ana.22484 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying magnetic resonance 
      imaging-defined white matter (WM) changes associated with age-related cognitive 
      decline remain poorly defined. We tested the hypothesis that WM lesions in older 
      adults, defined by diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), arise in the setting of vascular 
      brain injury (VBI) and are characterized by increased free radical injury and 
      aberrant oligodendrocyte lineage (OL) cell response to injury. METHODS: We undertook 
      a multimodal analysis of prefrontal cortex (PFC) WM from 25 autopsies derived from a 
      population-based cohort where VBI and Alzheimer disease (AD) frequently coincide. Ex 
      vivo high field strength DTI measurements of fractional anisotropy (FA), apparent 
      diffusion coefficient, and axial and radial (D(⊥) ) diffusivity were measured at 
      high magnetic field strength (11.7T) and analyzed relative to quantitative in vivo 
      biomarkers of free radical injury, an OL-specific marker Olig2, and histologic 
      evaluation of hyaluronan (HA), an inhibitor of OL maturation. RESULTS: Coincident AD 
      and VBI showed significant association with lower FA and a robust relationship 
      between decreasing FA and increasing D(⊥) . Free radical injury to docosahexaenoate 
      and adrenate in PFC WM was significantly elevated in cases with VBI independent of 
      AD, and was inversely correlated with FA. Similarly, increased density of 
      Olig2-immunoreactive cells in PFC WM was significantly associated with VBI 
      independent of AD and colocalized with regions enriched in HA. INTERPRETATION: 
      DTI-defined PFC WM lesions in older individuals are characterized by free radical 
      injury to myelin and neuroaxonal elements that coincides with pronounced expansion 
      of the pool of OL cells in HA-rich regions.

TI  - [HIV encephalopathy].
PG  - 887-9
AB  - HIV encephalopathy is one of the complexified viral diseases. In the infected 
      brains, HIV-infection is restricted in macrophages and microglia although its damage 
      extends to neurons and oligodendrocytes. Accumulating evidences have suggested that 
      many viral and host factors are involved in this disease. However, its precise 
      mechanism is still unsolved. To examine the mechanism of the disease, we developed 
      an HIV-1-infected human cell-transplanted mouse model and TNF-related 
      apoptosis-inducing ligand was identified as a neurotoxic host factors in 
      HIV-infected brain. Next, we examined the neurotoxic host factors using co-culture 
      system with macrophage-tropic HIV-1-infected macrophages as followings: Target brain 
      cells are murine neuron/glia mixed culture, murine neurospehre-forming culture and 
      rat brain hippocampus slice culture. In these systems, neurons and neural stem cells 
      were preferentially damaged. On the other hand, we also identified two anti-HIV 
      genes, CD 14 and CD63 (dN), which inhibit HIV-1-induced cytotoxicity using a 
      lentiviral screening system. Because they express on monocyte or activated 
      macrophage and microglia, these results suggest that CXCR4-using HIV-1 cannnot 
      expand inside of brain. We also extended the screening system to identify the host 
      factors which protect against HIV-1-induced encephalopathy. Our study will contibute 
      to development of new therapeutic strategy for HIV encephalopathy as well as other 
      CNS diseases.

TI  - Human olfactory bulb neural stem cells expressing hNGF restore cognitive deficit in 
      Alzheimer's disease rat model.
PG  - 116-30
LID - 10.1002/jcp.24688 [doi]
AB  - In this study, we aim to demonstrate the fate of allogenic adult human olfactory 
      bulb neural stem/progenitor cells (OBNSC/NPCs) transplanted into the rat hippocampus 
      treated with ibotenic acid (IBO), a neurotoxicant specific to hippocampal 
      cholinergic neurons that are lost in Alzheimer's disease. We assessed their possible 
      ability to survive, integrate, proliferate, and differentiate into different 
      neuronal and glial elements: we also evaluate their possible therapeutic potential, 
      and the mechanism(s) relevant to neuroprotection following their engraftment into 
      the CNS milieu. OBNSC/NPCs were isolated from adult human olfactory bulb patients, 
      genetically engineered to express GFP and human nerve growth factor (hNGF) by 
      lentivirus-mediated infection, and stereotaxically transplanted into the hippocampus 
      of IBO-treated animals and controls. Stereological analysis of engrafted OBNSCs 
      eight weeks post transplantation revealed a 1.89 fold increase with respect to the 
      initial cell population, indicating a marked ability for survival and proliferation. 
      In addition, 54.71 ± 11.38%, 30.18 ± 6.00%, and 15.09 ± 5.38% of engrafted OBNSCs 
      were identified by morphological criteria suggestive of mature neurons, 
      oligodendrocytes and astrocytes respectively. Taken together, this work demonstrated 
      that human OBNSCs expressing NGF ameliorate the cognitive deficiencies associated 
      with IBO-induced lesions in AD model rats, and the improvement can probably be 
      attributed primarily to neuronal and glial cell replacement as well as the trophic 
      influence exerted by the secreted NGF.

      mutation.
PG  - 595-600
LID - 10.1111/bpa.12051 [doi]
AB  - Most of the mutations in the presenilin-1 gene (PS-1) are associated with familial 
      Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, certain examples can be associated with 
      frontotemporal dementia (FTD). We performed a clinical evaluation of individuals 
      belonging to a family with the FTD phenotype, and additional molecular studies and 
      neuropathological assessment of the proband. The PS-1 M146V mutation was found in 
      the 50-year-old subject (the proband) with family history of early-onset FTD. 
      Neuropathological examination showed abundant amyloid plaques, widespread 
      neurofibrillary pathology, Pick bodies in the hippocampus and cortex, cortical 
      globose tangles and ubiquitin-positive nuclear inclusions in white matter 
      oligodendrocytes. We report a kindred with clinical features of FTD, whose proband 
      bore the PS-1 M146V mutation and showed diffuse Alzheimer's type pathology and Pick 
      bodies on post-mortem neuropathological examination. As with other mutations within 
      the same codon, this substitution may predispose to both diseases by affecting APP 
      and/or tau processing.

TI  - C9orf72 frontotemporal lobar degeneration is characterised by frequent neuronal 
      sense and antisense RNA foci.

AB  - An expanded GGGGCC repeat in a non-coding region of the C9orf72 gene is a common 
      cause of frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. 
      Non-coding repeat expansions may cause disease by reducing the expression level of 
      the gene they reside in, by producing toxic aggregates of repeat RNA termed RNA 
      foci, or by producing toxic proteins generated by repeat-associated non-ATG 
      translation. We present the first definitive report of C9orf72 repeat sense and 
      antisense RNA foci using a series of C9FTLD cases, and neurodegenerative disease and 
      normal controls. A sensitive and specific fluorescence in situ hybridisation 
      protocol was combined with protein immunostaining to show that both sense and 
      antisense foci were frequent, specific to C9FTLD, and present in neurons of the 
      frontal cortex, hippocampus and cerebellum. High-resolution imaging also allowed 
      accurate analyses of foci number and subcellular localisation. RNA foci were most 
      abundant in the frontal cortex, where 51 % of neurons contained foci. RNA foci also 
      occurred in astrocytes, microglia and oligodendrocytes but to a lesser degree than 
      in neurons. RNA foci were observed in both TDP-43- and p62-inclusion bearing 
      neurons, but not at a greater frequency than expected by chance. RNA foci abundance 
      in the frontal cortex showed a significant inverse correlation with age at onset of 
      disease. These data establish that sense and antisense C9orf72 repeat RNA foci are a 
      consistent and specific feature of C9FTLD, providing new insight into the 
      pathogenesis of C9FTLD.

TI  - Early white matter abnormalities, progressive brain pathology and motor deficits in 
      a novel knock-in mouse model of Huntington's disease.
PG  - 2508-27
LID - 10.1093/hmg/ddv016 [doi]
AB  - White matter abnormalities have been reported in premanifest Huntington's disease 
      (HD) subjects before overt striatal neuronal loss, but whether the white matter 
      changes represent a necessary step towards further pathology and the underlying 
      mechanism of these changes remains unknown. Here, we characterized a novel knock-in 
      mouse model that expresses mouse HD gene homolog (Hdh) with extended CAG repeat- 
      HdhQ250, which was derived from the selective breeding of HdhQ150 mice. HdhQ250 mice 
      manifest an accelerated and robust phenotype compared with its parent line. HdhQ250 
      mice exhibit progressive motor deficits, reduction in striatal and cortical volume, 
      accumulation of mutant huntingtin aggregation, decreased levels of DARPP32 and BDNF 
      and altered striatal metabolites. The abnormalities detected in this mouse model are 
      reminiscent of several aspects of human HD. In addition, disturbed myelination was 
      evident in postnatal Day 14 HdhQ250 mouse brain, including reduced levels of myelin 
      regulatory factor and myelin basic protein, and decreased numbers of myelinated 
      axons in the corpus callosum. Thinner myelin sheaths, indicated by increased G-ratio 
      of myelin, were also detected in the corpus callosum of adult HdhQ250 mice. 
      Moreover, proliferation of oligodendrocyte precursor cells is altered by mutant 
      huntingtin both in vitro and in vivo. Our data indicate that this model is suitable 
      for understanding comprehensive pathogenesis of HD in white matter and gray matter 
      as well as developing therapeutics for HD.

TI  - MR findings in adult-onset adrenoleukodystrophy.
PG  - 1227-37
AB  - PURPOSE: To describe the MR findings of brain and spinal cord in adult-onset 
      adrenoleukodystrophy. METHODS: One hundred sixty-four adult patients ranging from 19 
      to 74 years of age (119 men and 45 women) with clinically and biochemically proved 
      adrenoleukodystrophy underwent MR of the brain. In 30 patients the spinal cord also 
      was evaluated with MR. RESULTS: The brain MR findings were abnormal in 54 of 119 
      males and in 9 of 45 female heterozygotes and consisted of varying degrees of 
      demyelination of the cerebral white matter in 40 patients, corpus callosum in 25 
      patients, corticospinal tracts in 46 patients, visual tracts in 31 patients, and 
      auditory tracts in 18 patients. The thoracic spinal cord showed diffuse atrophy in 
      18 of 20 men and in 8 of 10 women. CONCLUSION: It is important to recognize the MR 
      findings of adult-onset adrenoleukodystrophy, because not uncommonly the clinical 
      and MR findings of adrenoleukodystrophy are misdiagnosed as multiple sclerosis, 
      olivopontocerebellar or spinocerebellar atrophy, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or 
      dementia. Analysis of the MR findings and correlation of the clinical findings has 
      permitted a tentative subdivision of adult-onset adrenoleukodystrophy population 
      into four subtypes that appear to differ in respect to prognosis and possibly 
      pathogenesis. MR evaluation of the brain in adrenoleukodystrophy also is helpful in 
      patient selection for experimental therapy, which is most effective if offered in 
      the early stage of the disease.

TI  - MR imaging of the corpus callosum.
PG  - 949-55
AB  - The corpus callosum is the major axonal commissure of the brain, connecting the two 
      cerebral hemispheres and providing communication between the cortical and 
      subcortical neurons. With MR imaging in the sagittal plane, the corpus callosum can 
      be depicted in great detail. We review the normal anatomy, development, and process 
      of myelination of the corpus callosum. The MR features of various pathologic 
      conditions involving the corpus callosum are described. Finally, we discuss the 
      evolving role of MR imaging in neuropsychiatric diseases with respect to the corpus 
      callosum.

TI  - Neuropathological correlates of temporal pole white matter hyperintensities in 
      CADASIL.
PG  - 2004-11
LID - 10.1161/STROKEAHA.108.528299 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: White matter (WM) hyperintensities on MRI or leukoaraiosis 
      is characteristic of stroke syndromes. Increased MRI signals in the anterior 
      temporal pole are suggested to be diagnostic for cerebral autosomal-dominant 
      arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL), with 90% 
      sensitivity and 100% specificity. The structural correlates of these specific WM 
      hyperintensities seen on T2-weighted and FLAIR sequences in the temporal pole of 
      CADASIL are unclear. We assessed pathological changes in postmortem tissue from the 
      temporal pole to reveal the cause of CADASIL-specific WM hyperintensities. METHODS: 
      A combination of tinctorial and immunostaining approaches and in vitro imaging 
      methods were used to quantify the extent of perivascular space (PVS), 
      arteriosclerosis determined as the sclerotic index, WM myelination as the myelin 
      index, and damage within the WM as accumulated degraded myelin basic protein in 
      samples of the anterior temporal pole from 9 CADASIL and 8 sporadic subcortical 
      ischemic vascular dementia cases, and 5 similarly aged (young) and 5 older controls. 
      Luxol fast blue-stained serial sections from a CADASIL case were also used to 
      reconstruct the temporal pole, which was then compared to the MR images. RESULTS: 
      Luxol fast blue sections used to reconstruct the temporal pole revealed an abundance 
      of enlarged PVS in the WM that topographically appeared as indistinct opaque 
      regions. The mean and total areas of the PVS per WM area (%PVS) were significantly 
      greater in CADASIL compared to the controls. The myelin index was severely reduced 
      in CADASIL in relation to the subcortical ischemic vascular dementia and control 
      sample that was consistent with increased immunoreactivity of degraded myelin basic 
      protein, indicating myelin degeneration. Cerebral microvessels associated with the 
      PVS exhibited a 4.5-fold greater number of basophilic (hyalinized) vessels and a 57% 
      increase in the sclerotic index values in CADASIL subjects compared to young 
      controls. A significant correlation between the quantity of hyalinized vessels and 
      sclerotic index values was also apparent (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest 
      that MRI hyperintensities in the temporal pole of CADASIL patients are explained by 
      enlarged PVS and degeneration of myelin accompanied by lack of drainage of the 
      interstitial fluid rather than lacunar infarcts. Consistent with the lack of MR 
      hypersignals in the temporal pole of older subcortical ischemic vascular dementia 
      subjects, our observations imply greater progression of pathological changes in 
      CADASIL patients.

PG  - 1021-31
AB  - Oxidative and nitrative injury is implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's 
      disease (AD) and Down syndrome (DS), but no direct evidence links this type of 
      injury to the formation of neurofibrillary tau lesions. To address this, we 
      generated a monoclonal antibody (mAb), n847, which recognizes nitrated tau and 
      alpha-synuclein. n847 detected nitrated tau in the insoluble fraction of AD, 
      corticobasal degeneration (CBD), and Pick's disease (PiD) brains by Western blots. 
      Immunohistochemistry (IHC) showed that n847 labeled neurons in the hippocampus and 
      neocortex of AD and DS brains. Double-label immunofluorescence with n847 and an 
      anti-tau antibody revealed partial co-localization of tau and n847 positive tangles, 
      while n847 immunofluorescence and Thioflavin-S double-staining showed that a subset 
      of n847-labeled neurons were Thioflavin-S-positive. In addition, immuno-electron 
      microscopy revealed that tau-positive filaments in tangle-bearing neurons were also 
      labeled by n847 and IHC of other tauopathies showed that some of glial and neuronal 
      tau pathologies in CBD, progressive supranuclear palsy, PiD, and frontotemporal 
      dementia with parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17 also were n847-positive. Finally, 
      nitrated and Thioflavin-S-positive tau aggregates were generated in a 
      oligodendrocytic cell line after treatment with peroxynitrite. Taken together, these 
      findings imply that nitrative injury is directly linked to the formation of 
      filamentous tau inclusions.

TI  - Frontal lobe white matter hyperintensities and neurofibrillary pathology in the 
      oldest old.
PG  - 2071-8
LID - 10.1212/WNL.0b013e318200d6f9 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Current studies suggest an interaction between vascular mechanisms and 
      neurodegenerative processes that leads to late-onset Alzheimer disease (AD). We 
      tested whether AD pathology was associated with white matter hyperintensities (WMH) 
      or cerebral infarcts in the oldest old individuals. METHODS: Brains from 132 
      subjects over 85 years old, who came to autopsy from the Vantaa 85+ population-based 
      cohort, were scanned by postmortem MRI and examined for neuropathologic changes. 
      Coronal images were analyzed to determine the degree of frontal and parietal 
      periventricular WMH (PVWMH) and deep WMH (DWMH) and cerebral infarcts. 
      Neuropathologic variables included Consortium to Establish a Registry for 
      Alzheimer's Disease scores for neuritic plaques and Braak staging among subjects in 
      5 groups: normal aging (NA), borderline with insufficient AD pathology, AD, AD plus 
      other pathology, and other primary degenerative diseases. RESULTS: Frontal DWMH were 
      detected in >50% of the sample. Both frontal PVWMH and DWMH were significantly more 
      extensive in the AD group compared to the NA group or the NA and borderline groups 
      combined. Frontal PVWMH and DWMH were also associated with increased Braak staging 
      (p = 0.03) and the neuritic plaque load (p = 0.01). Further analysis revealed there 
      were a greater number of cerebral infarcts associated with frontal DWMH (p = 0.03) 
      but not with frontal PVWMH. CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed an association between 
      neurofibrillary pathology and frontal PVWMH and DWMH (rather than parietal), as a 
      surrogate of small vessel disease, particularly in very old community-dwelling 
      individuals.

TI  - [The role of immunologic reactions in the pathogenesis in Binswanger's disease; a 
      clue to therapeutic approach].
PG  - 56-8
AB  - We examined the alterations of glial cells in the brains with Binswanger's disease. 
      In comparison to the brains with lacunar cerebral infarction and those from 
      non-neurological controls, oligodendroglia was decreased in number, and microglia 
      was increased and activated in the white matter lesions in Binswanger's disease. 
      Astroglia occasionally showed a regressive change, termed clasmatodendrosis. In 
      rodents, similar white matter lesions could be induced after chronic cerebral 
      hypoperfusion along with a numerical decrease of oligodendroglia, an increase of 
      astroglia and activation of microglia in the corresponding white matter. These white 
      matter lesions were suppressed by injection of immunosuppressant, cyclosporin A or 
      FK506, with a suppression of microglial activation. These findings indicate that the 
      lesion development in the white matter may be mediated by an immunologic reaction. 
      Unfortunately, these drugs may be inappropriate for a practical use in terms of 
      their side effects. Alternatively, we tried the use of anti-thrombin drug, 
      argatroban. In acute neurological exacerbation of Binswanger's disease, markers for 
      coagulation-fibrinolysis pathway were elevated significantly, and this activation 
      was suppressed along with a recovery of neurological symptoms such as parkinsonism 
      and pseudobulbar palsy. Thrombin contributes to a microcirculatory disturbance and 
      may also enhance an inflammatory response through the action of thrombin receptor.

TI  - Altered distribution of the gangliosides GM1 and GM2 in Alzheimer's disease.
PG  - 174-88
LID - 10.1159/000338181 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder where β-amyloid 
      tends to aggregate and form plaques. Lipid raft-associated ganglioside GM1 has been 
      suggested to facilitate β-amyloid aggregation; furthermore, GM1 and GM2 are 
      increased in lipid rafts isolated from cerebral cortex of AD cases. AIM/METHOD: The 
      distribution of GM1 and GM2 was studied by immunohistochemistry in the frontal and 
      temporal cortex of AD cases. Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) was included as a 
      contrast group. RESULTS: The distribution of GM1 and GM2 changes during the process 
      of AD (n = 5) and FTD (n = 3) compared to controls (n = 5). Altered location of the 
      GM1-positive small circular structures seems to be associated with myelin 
      degradation. In the grey matter, the staining of GM1-positive plasma membranes might 
      reflect neuronal loss in the AD/FTD tissue. The GM1-positive compact bundles were 
      only visible in cells located in the AD frontal grey matter, possibly reflecting 
      raft formation of GM1 and thus a pathological connection. Furthermore, our results 
      suggest GM2 to be enriched within vesicles of pyramidal neurons of the AD/FTD brain. 
      CONCLUSION: Our study supports the biochemical finding of ganglioside accumulation 
      in cellular membranes of AD patients and shows a redistribution of these molecules.

TI  - Disease targets and strategies for the therapeutic modulation of endogenous neural 
      stem and progenitor cells.
PG  - 453-60
AB  - Neural stem cells, able to self-renew and give rise to both neurons and glia, line 
      the cerebral ventricles of the adult human brain. Humans also harbor 
      lineage-restricted neuronal progenitors in the hippocampus and glial progenitor 
      cells in both the gray and white matter of the forebrain. These various stem and 
      progenitor cell types may provide targets for pharmacotherapy for a variety of 
      disorders of the central nervous system. Each resident progenitor phenotype may be 
      mobilized and induced to differentiate in vivo by the actions of both exogenous 
      growth factors and small molecule modulators of progenitor-selective signaling 
      pathways. This strategy may be particularly efficacious in neurodegenerations such 
      as Huntington's disease, in which lost neurons may be replenished through the 
      directed induction of progenitor cells lining the ventricular wall of the affected 
      striatum. Similarly, the mobilization of glial progenitor cells may permit the 
      introduction of new oligodendrocytes to demyelinated regions of adult white matter. 
      Our rapidly increasing understanding of the molecular control of progenitor cell 
      mobilization and differentiation should provide a wealth of new opportunities for 
      recruiting endogenous progenitors as a means of treating neurological disease.

TI  - Tau protein in frontotemporal dementia linked to chromosome 3 (FTD-3).
PG  - 878-82
AB  - Recent work on frontotemporal dementia (FTD) has revealed the existence of at least 
      3 genetically distinct groups of inherited FTD: FTDP-17, FTD and motor neuron 
      disease linked to chromosome 9, and FTD linked to chromosome 3 (FTD-3). Tau, on 
      chromosome 17, is the only gene where mutations have been identified and its 
      involvement in FTD has been firmly established. The genes on chromosome 9 and 
      chromosome 3 associated with familial forms of FTD remain to be identified. Abnormal 
      aggregates of tau protein characterize the brain lesions of FTDP-17 patients and 
      ubiquitin inclusions have been found in FTD with motor neuron disease linked to 
      chromosome 9. In this study the frontal cortices of 3 FTD-3 patients from a unique 
      Danish family were examined for characteristic neuropathological features. In these 
      brains tau inclusions were present in neurons and some glial cells in the absence of 
      beta-amyloid deposits. The presence of filamentous tau protein in the frontal cortex 
      of these patients suggests a possible link between tau and the genetic defect 
      present on chromosome 3 and associated with FTD-3, although the limited amount of 
      tau deposits observed makes it difficult to define this as a tauopathy.

      pathways.

AB  - Because mouse models play a crucial role in biomedical research related to the human 
      nervous system, understanding the similarities and differences between mouse and 
      human brain is of fundamental importance. Studies comparing transcription in human 
      and mouse have come to varied conclusions, in part because of their relatively small 
      sample sizes or underpowered methodologies. To better characterize gene expression 
      differences between mouse and human, we took a systems-biology approach by using 
      weighted gene coexpression network analysis on more than 1,000 microarrays from 
      brain. We find that global network properties of the brain transcriptome are highly 
      preserved between species. Furthermore, all modules of highly coexpressed genes 
      identified in mouse were identified in human, with those related to conserved 
      cellular functions showing the strongest between-species preservation. Modules 
      corresponding to glial and neuronal cells were sufficiently preserved between mouse 
      and human to permit identification of cross species cell-class marker genes. We also 
      identify several robust human-specific modules, including one strongly correlated 
      with measures of Alzheimer disease progression across multiple data sets, whose hubs 
      are poorly-characterized genes likely involved in Alzheimer disease. We present 
      multiple lines of evidence suggesting links between neurodegenerative disease and 
      glial cell types in human, including human-specific correlation of presenilin-1 with 
      oligodendrocyte markers, and significant enrichment for known neurodegenerative 
      disease genes in microglial modules. Together, this work identifies convergent and 
      divergent pathways in mouse and human, and provides a systematic framework that will 
      be useful for understanding the applicability of mouse models for human brain 
      disorders.

AB  - Dementia pugilistica (DP) is associated with chronic traumatic brain injury (CTBI), 
      and leads to a "punch drunk" syndrome characterized by impairments in memory and 
      executive function, behavioral changes, and motor signs. Microscopic features 
      include the accumulation of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), beta-amyloid (Aβ), and 
      TAR DNA binding protein 43 (TDP-43) pathology. Here we describe detailed clinical 
      and neuropathological data about a 55-year-old retired boxer (ApoE3/4), who 
      presented with executive dysfunction and behavioral impairments. At autopsy, 
      significant Aβ pathology was seen, primarily in the form of diffuse plaques. Tau 
      pathology was extensive and was determined to be of Braak and Braak stage VI. 
      Frontal white matter showed evidence of glial tau inclusions (astrocytes and 
      oligodendroglia). Cerebrovascular pathology was minimal with patchy amyloid 
      angiopathy. Inflammation was another key feature, including microglial activation 
      and significant C1q labeling of neurons, along with NFTs. TDP-43-positive pathology 
      was also observed. Inflammation may be a key inciting as well as propagating feature 
      of DP neuropathology.

TI  - Regulation of the brain isoprenoids farnesyl- and geranylgeranylpyrophosphate is 
      altered in male Alzheimer patients.
PG  - 251-7
LID - 10.1016/j.nbd.2009.05.005 [doi]
AB  - Post-translational modification of small GTPases by farnesyl- (FPP) and 
      geranylgeranylpyrophosphate (GGPP) has generated much attention due to their 
      potential contribution to cancer, cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases. 
      Prenylated proteins have been identified in numerous cell functions and elevated 
      levels of FPP and GGPP have been previously proposed to occur in Alzheimer disease 
      (AD) but have never been quantified. In the present study, we determined if the 
      mevalonate derived compounds FPP and GGPP are increased in brain grey and white 
      matter of male AD patients as compared with control samples. This study demonstrates 
      for the first time that FPP and GGPP levels are significantly elevated in human AD 
      grey and white matter but not cholesterol, indicating a potentially disease-specific 
      targeting of isoprenoid regulation independent of HMG-CoA-reductase. Further 
      suggesting a selective disruption of FPP and GGPP homeostasis in AD, we show that 
      inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase in vivo significantly reduced FPP, GGPP and 
      cholesterol abundance in mice with the largest effect on the isoprenoids. A 
      tentative conclusion is that if indeed regulation of FPP and GGPP is altered in AD 
      brain such changes may stimulate protein prenylation and contribute to AD 
      neuropathophysiology.

TI  - Neurological cholinesterases in the normal brain and in Alzheimer's disease: 
      relationship to plaques, tangles, and patterns of selective vulnerability.
PG  - 373-84
AB  - Butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) and an altered form of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) 
      accumulate in the plaques and tangles of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The sources for 
      these plaque- and tangle-bound cholinesterases have not been identified. We now 
      report that AChE and BChE activities with pH preferences and inhibitor selectivities 
      identical to those of plaque- and tangle-bound cholinesterases are found in the 
      astrocytes and oligodendrocytes of control and AD brains. These glial-type 
      cholinesterases are selectively inhibited by indolamines and protease inhibitors. In 
      control brains glial-type cholinesterases appear confined to the intracellular 
      space, whereas in patients with AD they decorate plaques and tangles as well. In 
      control and AD brains AChE-positive glia are distributed throughout the cortical 
      layers and subcortical white matter, whereas BChE-positive glia reach high densities 
      only in the deep cortical layers and white matter. In non-AD control brains, the 
      ratio of BChE to AChE glia was higher in entorhinal and inferotemporal cortex, two 
      regions with a high susceptibility to the pathology of AD, than in primary 
      somatosensory and visual cortex, two areas with a relatively lower susceptibility to 
      the disease process. There was no age-related differences in the density or 
      distribution of cholinesterase-positive glia. In comparison with age-matched control 
      specimens, AD brains had a significantly higher density of BChE glia and a lower 
      density of AChE glia in entorhinal and inferotemporal regions but not in the primary 
      somatosensory or visual areas. These results suggest that glia constitute a likely 
      source for the cholinesterase activity of plaques and tangles and that a high ratio 
      of BChE- to AChE-positive glia may play a permissive or causative role in the 
      neuropathology of AD.

AB  - Although amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary pathology play important roles in 
      Alzheimer disease (AD), our understanding of AD is incomplete, and the contribution 
      of microglia and iron to neurodegeneration is unknown. High-field magnetic resonance 
      imaging (MRI) is exquisitely sensitive to microscopic iron. To explore 
      iron-associated neuroinflammatory AD pathology, we studied AD and control human 
      brain specimens by (1) performing ultra-high resolution ex vivo 7 Tesla MRI, (2) 
      coregistering the MRI with successive histologic staining for iron, microglia, 
      amyloid beta, and tau, and (3) quantifying the relationship between magnetic 
      resonance signal intensity and histological staining. In AD, we identified numerous 
      small MR hypointensities primarily within the subiculum that were best explained by 
      the combination of microscopic iron and activated microglia (p = 0.025), in 
      contradistinction to the relatively lesser contribution of tau or amyloid. 
      Neuropathologically, this suggests that microglial-mediated neurodegeneration may 
      occur in the hippocampal formation in AD and is detectable by ultra-high resolution 
      MRI.

TI  - Phosphorylated protein kinases associated with neuronal and glial tau deposits in 
      argyrophilic grain disease.
PG  - 62-78
AB  - Tau phosphorylation was examined in argyrophilic grain disease (AGD) by using the 
      phosphospecific tau antibodies Thr181, Ser202, Ser214, Ser 396 and Ser422, and 
      antibodies to non-phosphorylated and phosphorylated mitogen-activated protein kinase 
      (MAPK), extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK), stress-activated kinase 
      (SAPK), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), p38 kinase (p-38), 
      alpha-calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (alphaCaM kinase II), and glycogen 
      synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3), all of which regulate phosphorylation at specific sites 
      of tau. This is the first study in which the role of protein kinases in tau 
      phosphorylation has been examined in AGD. Hyperphosphorylated tau accumulated in 
      grains and pre-tangles in the hippocampus, dentate gyrus, entorhinal and 
      trans-entorhinal cortices, and amygdala in all cases. Ballooned neurons in the 
      amygdala, entorhinal, insular and cingulate cortex, and claustrum contained 
      alphaB-crystallyn and phosphorylated neurofilament epitopes. Some astrocytes and 
      scattered oligodendrocytes containing coiled bodies were recognized with anti-tau 
      antibodies. A few tangles were observed in the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus 
      corresponding to Alzheimer's disease (AD) stages I-III of Braak and Braak. None of 
      the present cases was associated with progressive supranuclear palsy or with 
      alpha-synuclein pathology. Two bands of phospho-tau of 64 and 68 kDa were observed 
      in Western blots of sarkosyl-insoluble fractions enriched with abnormal filaments in 
      AGD, a pattern that contrasts with the 4-band pattern obtained in AD. No 
      modifications in the expression of non-phosphorylated MEK-1, ERK2 and 
      GSK-3alpha/beta, as revealed by immunohistochemistry, were seen in AGD, but 
      sarkosyl-insoluble fractions were particularly enriched in JNK-1 and alphaCaM kinase 
      II. Increased expression of the phosphorylated (P) forms of MAPK/ERK, SAPK/JNK, p38 
      and GSK-3beta was found in grains and tau-containing cells in AGD. MAPK/ERK-P 
      immunoreactivity was observed in pre-tangles and, diffusely, in the cytoplasm of 
      ballooned neurons, but not in grains. Strong SAPK/JNK-P and P38-P, and moderate 
      GSK-3b-P immunoreactivities selectively occured in grains, in neurons with 
      pre-tangles and in the peripheral region of the cytoplasm of ballooned neurons. 
      MAPK/ERK-P, SAPK/JNK-P, p38-P and GSK-3beta-P were expressed in tau-containing 
      astrocytes and in oligodendrocytes with coiled bodies. Western blots revealed kinase 
      expression in sarkosyl-insoluble fractions but none of the phospho-kinase antibodies 
      recognized hyper-phosphorylated tau protein. These findings indicate complex, 
      specific profiles of tau phosphorylation and concomitant activation of precise 
      kinases that have the capacity to phosphorylate tau at specific sites in AGD. These 
      kinases co-localize abnormal tau in selected structures and cells, including neurons 
      with pre-tangles, ballooned neurons, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. Most of these 
      kinases are involved in cell death and cell survival in certain experimental 
      paradigms. However, double-labeling studies with the method of in situ end-labeling 
      of nuclear DNA fragmentation and cleaved (active) caspase-3 immunohistochemistry 
      show no expression of apoptosis and death markers in cells bearing phosphorylated 
      kinases.

TI  - Intracerebral streptozotocin model of type 3 diabetes: relevance to sporadic 
      Alzheimer's disease.
PG  - 13-33
AB  - The cascade of Alzheimer's disease (AD) neurodegeneration is associated with 
      persistent oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, impaired energy metabolism, 
      and activation of pro-death signaling pathways. More recently, studies with human 
      postmortem brain tissue linked many of the characteristic molecular and pathological 
      features of AD to reduced expression of the insulin and insulin-like growth factor 
      (IGF) genes and their corresponding receptors. We now demonstrate using an in vivo 
      model of intracerebral Streptozotocin (ic-STZ), that chemical depletion of insulin 
      and IGF signaling mechanisms combined with oxidative injury is sufficient to cause 
      AD-type neurodegeneration. The ic-STZ-injected rats did not have elevated blood 
      glucose levels, and pancreatic architecture and insulin immunoreactivity were 
      similar to control, yet their brains were reduced in size and exhibited 
      neurodegeneration associated with cell loss, gliosis, and increased immunoreactivity 
      for p53, active glycogen synthase kinase 3beta, phospho-tau, ubiquitin, and 
      amyloid-beta. Real time quantitative RT-PCR studies demonstrated that the 
      ic-STZ-treated brains had significantly reduced expression of genes corresponding to 
      neurons, oligodendroglia, and choline acetyltransferase, and increased expression of 
      genes encoding glial fibrillary acidic protein, microglia-specific proteins, 
      acetylcholinesterase, tau, and amyloid precursor protein. These abnormalities were 
      associated reduced expression of genes encoding insulin, IGF-II, insulin receptor, 
      IGF-I receptor, and insulin receptor substrate-1, and reduced ligand binding to the 
      insulin and IGF-II receptors. These results demonstrate that many of the 
      characteristic features of AD-type neurodegeneration can be produced experimentally 
      by selectively impairing insulin/IGF functions together with increasing oxidative 
      stress, and support our hypothesis that AD represents a neuro-endocrine disorder 
      associated with brain-specific perturbations in insulin and IGF signaling 
      mechanisms, i.e. Type 3 diabetes.

TI  - White matter tauopathy with globular glial inclusions: a distinct sporadic 
      frontotemporal lobar degeneration.
PG  - 963-75
LID - 10.1097/NEN.0b013e318187a80f [doi]
AB  - Frontotemporal lobar degenerations are a group of disorders characterized by 
      circumscribed degeneration of the frontal and temporal lobes and diverse 
      histopathologic features. We report clinical, neuropathologic, ultrastructural, 
      biochemical, and genetic data on 7 individuals with a 4-repeat tauopathy 
      characterized by the presence of globular glial inclusions (GGIs) in brain white 
      matter. Clinical manifestations were compatible with the behavioral variant of 
      frontotemporal dementia and included motor neuron symptoms; there was prominent 
      neuronal loss in the frontal and temporal cortex, subiculum, and amygdala. The 
      surrounding white matter showed abundant GGIs composed of abnormal filaments present 
      mostly in oligodendrocytes. The severity of white matter tau abnormalities 
      correlated with a reduction in myelin and axons and with microglial activation. 
      Western blotting of sarkosyl-insoluble tau demonstrated the presence of 2 major tau 
      bands of 64 and 68 kd. No mutations in the microtubule-associated protein tau gene 
      were detected in 2 affected individuals. We propose that 4-repeat tau-immunoreactive 
      GGIs are the neuropathologic hallmark of a distinct sporadic tauopathy with variable 
      clinical presentations that include frontotemporal dementia and occasionally upper 
      motor neuron disease. This type of tauopathy with GGIs expands the group of 
      neurodegenerativedisorders in which oligodendroglial pathology predominates, beyond 
      the synucleinopathy multiple system atrophy disorders.

TI  - [Blood-brain barrier--function of Mato cells].
PG  - 55-7
AB  - Brain because of its functions, is isolated from either external or internal 
      environment. This function is performed by skull, cerebral meninges, cerebrospinal 
      fluid and unique system of mechanisms and barriers restricting exchange of oxygen, 
      soluble substances between blood, nervous tissue and cerebrospinal fluid. Mato 
      cells, located in Virchow-Robin's space play a key role in blood-brain barrier. Mato 
      cells are rich in hydrolytic enzymes. They act as phagocytes in blood-brain barrier 
      by scavenger receptors, which take part in eliminating excess of unfavorable 
      substances from environment. Ageing, hypercholesterolemia and vitamin E deficiency 
      can cause degeneration of perivascular cells and limit their protective function. 
      Mato cells probably are responsible for pathogenesis of various diseases, f.e. 
      Alzheimer disease, diabetic rethinopathy, encephalitis.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) a neurodegenerative disorder of widely distributed cortical 
      networks evolves over years while A beta (Aβ) oligomer neurotoxicity occurs within 
      seconds to minutes. This disparity combined with disappointing outcomes of 
      anti-amyloid clinical trials challenges the centrality of Aβ as principal mediator 
      of neurodegeneration. Reconsideration of late life AD as the end-product of 
      intermittent regional failure of the neuronal support system to meet the needs of 
      vulnerable brain areas offers an alternative point of view. This model introduces 
      four ideas: (1) That Aβ is a synaptic signaling peptide that becomes toxic in 
      circumstances of metabolic stress. (2) That intense synaptic energy and maintenance 
      requirements of cortical hubs may exceed resources during peak demand initiating a 
      neurotoxic cascade in these selectively vulnerable regions. (3) That axonal 
      transport to and from neuron soma cannot account fully for high mitochondrial 
      densities and other requirements of distant terminal axons. (4) That neurons as 
      specialists in information management, delegate generic support functions to 
      astrocytes and other cell types. Astrocytes use intercellular transport by exosomes 
      and tunneling nanotubes (TNTs) to deliver mitochondria, substrates and protein 
      reprocessing services to axonal sites distant from neuronal soma. This viewpoint 
      implicates the brain's support system and its disruption by various age and 
      disease-related insults as significant mediators of neurodegenerative disease. A 
      better understanding of this system should broaden concepts of neurodegeneration and 
      facilitate development of effective treatments.

PG  - 823-31
AB  - During the last fifteen years, a new interest has been shown in cerebral lacunes due 
      to the development of brain imagery using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). The 
      concept of lacunar infarction as defined par Fisher (lacunar hypothesis) can no 
      longer be accepted. Clinical data showed that the so-called lacunar clinical 
      syndromes were far from being specific and could be observed in corticosubcortical 
      infarcts. Epidemiological data pointed out that hypertensive disease was not found 
      in many cases of lacunar infarction. Pathological studies suggest that there are two 
      types of lacunar infarction. Lacunar infarcts resulting in clinical stroke syndromes 
      (type 1 a lacunae) seem to be mainly due to obstruction of the trunk of a 
      perforating artery by atherosclerosis. Silent lacunar infarcts (type 1 b lacunae) 
      result from obstruction of small ramifications of the perforating arteries by a non 
      specific microangiopathy related to age, atherosclerosis, cardiovascular disease as 
      well as to hypertensive disease. Silent lacunar infarcts and dilatation of 
      perivascular spaces (type 3 lacunae) are associated with the white matter 
      hyperintensities shown by MRI in elderly subjects. Lacunar infarcts and diffuse 
      white matter hyperintensities are related to small vessel changes and ischaemic 
      damages resulting from (a) arteriolar occlusion and or (b) loss of autoregulation 
      associated with variations in systemic blood pressure. Both lesions constitute a 
      high risk to develop Vascular Cognitive Impairment (Hachinski) and are frequently 
      associated with Alzheimer's disease. Cases of giant or expanding type 3 lacunae have 
      been reported in the last ten years but the physiopathology of such lacunes and 
      their relationship with clinical symptoms remain a puzzle.

TI  - Cellular management of iron in the brain.
PG  - 33-44
AB  - All organs including the brain contain iron, and the proteins involved in iron 
      uptake (transferrin and transferrin receptor) and intracellular storage (ferritin). 
      However, because the brain resides behind a barrier and has a heterogeneous 
      population of cells, there are aspects of its iron management that are unique. Iron 
      management, the timely delivery of appropriate amounts of iron, is crucial to normal 
      brain development and function. Mismanagement of cellular iron can result not only 
      in decreased metabolic activity but increased vulnerability to oxidative damage. 
      There is regional specificity in cell deposition of iron and the iron regulatory 
      proteins. However, the sequestration of iron in the brain seems primarily the 
      responsibility of oligodendrocytes, as these cells contain most of the stainable 
      iron in the brain. Transferrin, the iron-mobilizing protein, is also found 
      predominantly in these cells. The transferrin receptor is abundantly expressed on 
      blood vessels, large neurons in the cortex, striatum, and hippocampus, and is also 
      present on oligodendrocytes and astrocytes. Ferritin, the intracellular iron storage 
      protein, consists of 2 subunits which are functionally distinct, and we provide 
      evidence in this report that the cellular distribution of the ferritin subunits is 
      also distinct. In addition, changes in the cellular distribution of iron and its 
      associated regulatory proteins occur in Alzheimer's disease. Neuritic plaques 
      contain relatively large amounts of stainable iron, and the surrounding cells 
      robustly immunostain for ferritin and the transferrin receptor. Analysis of the 
      cellular distribution of iron indicates the different levels of requirement of iron 
      in the brain by different cell types and should ultimately elucidate how cells 
      acquire and maintain this essential component of oxidative metabolism. In addition, 
      changes in the ability of cells to deliver and manage iron may provide insight into 
      altered metabolic activity with age and disease as well as identify cell populations 
      at risk for iron-induced oxidative stress.

TI  - Dementia with Lewy bodies from the perspective of tauopathy.
PG  - 265-70
AB  - We immunohistochemically investigated the prevalence and pattern of phosphorylated 
      tau accumulation in neurons and glia in 46 cases of dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). 
      Tau-positive neurons composed of neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) and pretangle neurons 
      were found in the hippocampal area in all 46 cases, although the ratio of pretangle 
      neurons in tau-positive neurons was higher in the cases showing low NFT stages. 
      Tau-positive astrocytes were found in the periventricular area in 18 of 46 cases, 
      and partly represented argyrophilic thorn-shaped astrocytes. In contrast, 
      tau-positive oligodendroglia were found in the subcortical white matter in 9 of 46 
      cases, and represented argyrophilic coiled bodies. Tau-positive argyrophilic grains 
      were found in the hippocampal area in the same cases as those with coiled bodies. 
      The 9 cases with tau-positive coiled bodies and grains were included in the 18 cases 
      with tau-positive astrocytes, and showed larger proportions in the low NFT stages 
      than the 46 cases with tau-positive neurons. Tau-positive neurons were positive both 
      to anti-three-repeat (3R) and -4R tau-specific antibodies, while tau-positive 
      astrocytes, coiled bodies and grains were predominantly positive to anti-4R 
      tau-specific antibody. These tau-positive structures were negative to 
      anti-alpha-synuclein antibody. These findings suggest that the tau accumulation in 
      DLB represents both tau-positive neurons with all six tau isoforms and tau-positive 
      astrocytes, coiled bodies and grains with the 4R tau isoform, and that the different 
      cytoskeletal abnormalities form a link between some neurodegenerative dementing 
      disorders including DLB.

TI  - Quantifying age-related myelin breakdown with MRI: novel therapeutic targets for 
      preventing cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease.
PG  - S53-9
AB  - Myelin plays an essential role in brain structure and function and the human brain 
      is uniquely dependent on the elaboration of this late invention of evolution. Our 
      brain has the most extensive and protracted process of myelination that extends to 
      approximately age 50 in cortical regions that have the highest risk for developing 
      Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology. This myelin-centered model of the human brain 
      asserts that unique vulnerabilities of myelin, especially late-developed myelin, and 
      the oligodendrocytes that produce it are directly pertinent to many uniquely human 
      neuropsychiatric diseases including late-life neurodegenerative disorders such as 
      AD. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technology permits the in vivo assessment of 
      the roughly quadratic (inverted U) lifelong trajectory of human myelin development 
      and its subsequent breakdown. There is close agreement between neuropsychology, 
      neuropathology, and imaging measures suggesting that the process of myelin breakdown 
      begins in adulthood, accelerates as aging progresses, and underlies both age-related 
      cognitive declines and the most powerful risk factor of dementia-causing disorders 
      such as AD: age. This myelin-centered model together with the technology that makes 
      it possible to measure the trajectory of myelin breakdown provide a framework for 
      developing novel treatments, as well as assessing efficacy of currently available 
      treatments, intended to slow or reverse the breakdown process in both clinically 
      healthy as well as symptomatic populations. Such treatments can be expected to have 
      a wide spectrum of efficacy and impact multiple human disease processes including 
      potentially slowing brain aging and thus provide opportunities for primary 
      prevention of age-related degenerative disorders such as AD.

TI  - Increased A beta peptides and reduced cholesterol and myelin proteins characterize 
      white matter degeneration in Alzheimer's disease.
PG  - 11080-90
AB  - Relative to the gray matter, there is a paucity of information regarding white 
      matter biochemical alterations and their contribution to Alzheimer's disease (AD). 
      Biochemical analyses of AD white matter combining size-exclusion, normal phase, and 
      gas chromatography, immunoassays, and Western blotting revealed increased quantities 
      of Abeta40 and Abeta42 in AD white matter accompanied by significant decreases in 
      the amounts of myelin basic protein, myelin proteolipid protein, and 2',3'-cyclic 
      nucleotide 3'-phosphodiesterase. In addition, the AD white matter cholesterol levels 
      were significantly decreased while total fatty acid content was increased. In some 
      instances, these white matter biochemical alterations were correlated with patient 
      apolipoprotein E genotype, Braak stage, and gender. Our observations suggest that 
      extensive white matter axonal demyelination underlies Alzheimer's pathology, 
      resulting in loss of capacitance and serious disturbances in nerve conduction, 
      severely damaging brain function. These white matter alterations undoubtedly 
      contribute to AD pathogenesis and may represent the combined effects of neuronal 
      degeneration, microgliosis, oligodendrocyte injury, microcirculatory disease, and 
      interstitial fluid stasis. To accurately assess the success of future therapeutic 
      interventions, it is necessary to have a complete appreciation of the full scope and 
      extent of AD pathology.

TI  - Damage and repair of DNA in HIV encephalitis.
PG  - 955-65
AB  - Neuronal damage and dementia are common sequelae of HIV encephalitis. The mechanism 
      by which HIV infection of CNS macrophages results in neuronal damage is not known. 
      We examined the brains from 15 AIDS autopsies (8 with HIV encephalitis and 7 
      without) and 4 non-infected control autopsies for the presence of DNA strand breaks, 
      for associated changes in the expression of the DNA repair enzymes KU80 and Poly 
      (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), and for accumulation of amyloid precursor protein 
      (APP). Abundant DNA damage was observed with terminal transferase-mediated dUTP nick 
      end-labeling (TUNEL), however, there was no morphologic evidence of significant 
      neuroglial apoptosis. The DNA repair enzyme KU80 was immunocytochemically detectable 
      in neuronal and glial cells in autopsy brains from patients with and without HIV 
      encephalitis; however, in cases with HIV encephalitis the staining was more 
      prominent than in the infected or non-infected controls without encephalitis. There 
      was no difference in KU80 immunostaining in oligodendroglia from autopsies with and 
      without encephalitis. Immunostaining for PARP was more intense in gray and white 
      matter of cases with HIV encephalitis. No clear spatial relationship existed between 
      expression of DNA repair enzymes and the spatial proximity of microglial nodules or 
      HIV-infected macrophages. The cytoplasm of cortical and subcortical neurons 
      immunostained for APP Stronger cortical neuronal APP staining was observed in cases 
      without HIV encephalitis. Staining of deep gray matter neurons was similar, 
      irrespective of the presence or absence of encephalitis. While foci of intense APP 
      staining were noted in white matter not related to HIV infection, they were 
      associated with foci of opportunistic infections (e.g. due to CMV or PML). We 
      conclude that damaged DNA and altered patterns of expression of DNA repair proteins 
      and APP are common findings in the brains of AIDS patients at autopsy, but do not 
      have a spatial relationship to HIV-infected macrophages.

TI  - Some immunohistochemical features of argyrophilic grain dementia with normal 
      cortical choline acetyltransferase levels but extensive subcortical pathology and 
      markedly reduced dopamine.
PG  - 3-13
AB  - Detailed immunohistochemical and biochemical studies are reported on two cases of 
      progressive dementia showing no Alzheimer-type pathology but extensive argyrophilic 
      grains as described previously by Braak and Braak. These cases had no specific 
      clinical features, and the pathology of these brains showed subcortical gliosis 
      (proliferation of astrocytes and microglia) without significant neuronal losses. 
      Interesting novel immunohistochemical findings were the profuse appearance of 
      complement-activated oligodendrocytes and oligodendroglial microtubular masses. 
      Their appearance seems to indicate oligodendroglial reactions to widespread damage 
      of myelinated axons. Cortical levels of choline acetyltransferase were normal, but 
      striatal levels of dopamine and its metabolites were markedly reduced. This disease 
      may be consistent with the criteria for progressive subcortical gliosis.

TI  - Mesial temporal astrocyte tau pathology in the MRC-CFAS ageing brain cohort.
PG  - 15-24
LID - 10.1159/000341581 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Glial tau pathology is seen in certain tauopathies and in ageing. We 
      determined its frequency in ageing mesial temporal lobe and its relationship to 
      other tau pathologies in the MRC-CFAS population-representative neuropathology 
      cohort. METHODS: Mesial temporal lobe, including hippocampus, amygdala, entorhinal 
      cortex and white matter, was examined using immunohistochemistry with the AT8 
      antibody to phospho-tau and RD3 and RD4 antibodies to 3R and 4R tau isoforms. 
      Gallyas silver stain was used to detect fibrillar aggregates. RESULTS: Thorn-shaped 
      astrocytes (TSA), positive with AT8, RD4 and Gallyas, were present in 49% of cases. 
      They were particularly prevalent in subpial, periventricular and white matter 
      perivascular locations and were less frequent in grey matter. Coiled bodies were 
      seen in 18.8%. TSA were not related to Braak neurofibrillary tangle or hippocampal 
      tangle pathology stages. TSA in grey matter were associated with coiled bodies (p = 
      0.011) and argyrophilic grains (p = 0.048), which were identified in 11.5% of cases. 
      They did not correlate with dementia. CONCLUSIONS: Astrocyte tau pathology is common 
      in the ageing mesial temporal lobe. Its formation is independent of Alzheimer-type 
      pathology. It is a 4R tauopathy, which may form part of a mesial temporal 
      age-related 4R tauopathy that includes oligodendroglial tau and argyrophilic grains.

TI  - The neurodegenerative process in a neurotoxic rat model and in patients with 
      Huntington's disease: histopathological parallels and differences.
PG  - 783-92
LID - 10.1016/j.acthis.2010.11.007 [doi]
AB  - Although Huntington's disease (HD) occurs only in humans, the use of animal models 
      is crucial for HD research. New genetic models may provide novel insights into HD 
      pathogenesis, but their relevance to human HD is problematic, particularly owing to 
      a lower number of typically degenerated and dying striatal neurons and consequent 
      insignificant reactive gliosis. Hence, neurotoxin-induced animal models are widely 
      used for histopathological studies. Unlike in humans, the neurodegenerative process 
      (NDP) of the HD phenotype develops very fast after the application of quinolinic 
      acid (QA). For that reason, we compared three groups of rats in more advanced stages 
      (1-12 months) of the QA lesion with 3 representative HD cases of varying length and 
      grade. The outcomes of our long-term histological study indicate that significant 
      parallels may be drawn between HD autopsies and QA-lesioned rat brains (particularly 
      between post-lesional months 3 and 9) in relation to (1) the progression of 
      morphological changes related to the neuronal degeneration, primarily the 
      rarefaction of neuropil affecting the density as well as the character of synapses, 
      resulting in severe striatal atrophy and (2) the participation of oligodendrocytes 
      in reparative gliosis. Conversely, the development and character of reactive 
      astrogliosis is principally conditioned by the severity of striatal NDP in the 
      context of neuron-glia relationship. Despite the above-described differences, 
      morphological patterns in which the components of striatal parenchyma react to the 
      progression of NDP are similar in both human and rat brains. Our study specifies the 
      possibilities of interpreting the morphological findings gained from the QA-induced 
      animal model of HD in relation to HD post-mortem specimens.

TI  - Differential induction and spread of tau pathology in young PS19 tau transgenic mice 
      following intracerebral injections of pathological tau from Alzheimer's disease or 
      corticobasal degeneration brains.
PG  - 221-37
LID - 10.1007/s00401-014-1373-0 [doi]
AB  - Filamentous tau pathologies are hallmark lesions of several neurodegenerative 
      tauopathies including Alzheimer's disease (AD) and corticobasal degeneration (CBD) 
      which show cell type-specific and topographically distinct tau inclusions. Growing 
      evidence supports templated transmission of tauopathies through functionally 
      interconnected neuroanatomical pathways suggesting that different self-propagating 
      strains of pathological tau could account for the diverse manifestations of 
      neurodegenerative tauopathies. Here, we describe the rapid and distinct cell 
      type-specific spread of pathological tau following intracerebral injections of CBD 
      or AD brain extracts enriched in pathological tau (designated CBD-Tau and AD-Tau, 
      respectively) in young human mutant P301S tau transgenic (Tg) mice (line PS19) ~6-9 
      months before they show onset of mutant tau transgene-induced tau pathology. At 1 
      month post-injection of CBD-Tau, tau inclusions developed predominantly in 
      oligodendrocytes of the fimbria and white matter near the injection sites with 
      infrequent intraneuronal tau aggregates. In contrast, injections of AD-Tau in young 
      PS19 mice induced tau pathology predominantly in neuronal perikarya with little or 
      no oligodendrocyte involvement 1 month post-injection. With longer post-injection 
      survival intervals of up to 6 months, CBD-Tau- and AD-Tau-induced tau pathology 
      spread to different brain regions distant from the injection sites while maintaining 
      the cell type-specific pattern noted above. Finally, CA3 neuron loss was detected 3 
      months post-injection of AD-Tau but not CBD-Tau. Thus, AD-Tau and CBD-Tau represent 
      specific pathological tau strains that spread differentially and may underlie 
      distinct clinical and pathological features of these two tauopathies. Hence, these 
      strains could become targets to develop disease-modifying therapies for CBD and AD.

TI  - Brain changes in dementia of Alzheimer's type relevant to new imaging diagnostic 
      methods.
PG  - 297-308
AB  - The aim of the article is to correlate grey and white matter changes and their 
      topography to the results of modern methods for brain imaging such as CT, rCBF, PET, 
      SPECT and NMR in Alzheimer's type of dementia. The findings are based on the study 
      of a large material investigated thoroughly patho-anatomically. The findings are 
      correlated with psychiatric and neurophysiologic follow-up studies. The degenerative 
      grey matter process shows a regionally varying accent according to a pattern which 
      is consistent and typical for the disease. This corresponds to metabolic changes on 
      rCBF, PET and SPECT and thereby becomes of diagnostic value. This pattern is largely 
      symmetric. Metabolic asymmetries have however been reported on PET scans. In this 
      context individual variations of the topographic degenerative brain pattern and 
      normal anatomical brain asymmetries are of interest. The white matter however also 
      frequently shows changes, in particular loss of myelin and axons and a mild gliosis, 
      slight in 1/3 of the cases and severe in an additional 1/3. These changes cause a 
      decrease of density in the centrum semiovale correlating to lipid depletion. They 
      may also influence the ventricular shape and size, of interest in CT or NMR studies. 
      Also here variations in ventricular shape, normal and such due to pathological 
      processes unrelated to the Alzheimer disease, may cause confusion, regarding degree 
      of atrophy and even type of brain process. Such factors should be considered in the 
      interpretation of non-invasive brain studies.

PG  - 421-9
AB  - We have developed isolated and mixed cultures of microglia, astrocytes, and 
      oligodendrocytes from rapid (mean of 2 h 55 min) autopsies of nondemented elderly 
      patients and patients with Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and multiple 
      sclerosis. Cultures were derived from both the corpus callosum (CC) and superior 
      frontal gyrus (SFG). Cultured microglia phagocytosed latex beads, were reactive for 
      Dil-acetylated low density lipoprotein, were immunoreactive for CD68 and major 
      histocompatibility complex II markers, and were not immunoreactive for fibroblast, 
      astrocyte, or oligodendrocyte markers. Cultured astrocytes included fibrous and 
      protoplasmic types, were immunoreactive for GFAP, and were not immunoreactive for 
      fibroblast, microglia, or oligodendrocyte markers. Cultured oligodendrocytes were 
      poorly adherent, were slow to develop, were immunoreactive for galactocerebroside, 
      and were not immunoreactive for fibroblast, microglia, or astrocyte markers. Because 
      they are readily manipulated under controlled experimental conditions, and because 
      they permit immediate access to individual cells and sets of cells from patients who 
      have actually suffered the disease, these cultures may provide an important new tool 
      for unravelling the etiology and pathogenesis of human CNS disorders.

TI  - The glial response to CNS HIV infection includes p53 activation and increased 
      expression of p53 target genes.
PG  - 359-70
AB  - HIV-associated dementia (HAD) is a chronic neuroinflammatory disease that remains an 
      important clinical problem without available rational treatment. As HIV does not 
      infect neurons, the pathogenesis of HAD is thought to be secondary to the impact of 
      infected leukocytes, including parenchymal microglia, which can secrete inflammatory 
      mediators and viral products that alter the function of surrounding uninfected 
      cells. We previously reported that the transcription factor p53 accumulates in 
      neurons, microglia, and astrocytes of HAD patients. We have also shown that 
      microglia from p53-deficient mice fail to induce neurotoxicity in response to the 
      HIV coat protein gp120 in a coculture system, supporting the hypothesis that p53 
      plays a pathogenic role in the chronic neuroinflammatory component of HIV-associated 
      neurodegeneration. We analyzed the extent and cell type specificity of p53 
      accumulation in subcortical white matter of ten AIDS patients that had previously 
      been shown to demonstrate white matter p53 accumulation. To determine if p53 
      activation functioned to alter gene expression in HAD, cortical tissue sections were 
      also immunolabeled for the p53 target genes Bax and p21(WAF1). These studies reveal 
      that microglia, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes all demonstrate p53 activation in 
      response to HIV infection. We observed immunoreactivity for both Bax and p21(WAF1) 
      in neurons and glia from patients demonstrating elevated p53 immunoreactivity. Our 
      findings demonstrate that widespread increased p53 expression is present in HAD. 
      Activation of p53 mediated pathways in the glia of HAD patients may contribute to 
      the neuroinflammatory processes that promote neurodegeneration by inhibiting glial 
      proliferation and/or promoting glial cell dysfunction.

TI  - Efficacy and toxicity of clioquinol treatment and A-beta42 inoculation in the 
      APP/PSI mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.
PG  - 494-506
AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common human neurodegenerative disease, is 
      characterized pathologically by numerous deposits of amyloid plaques in the brain. 
      Systemic administration of clioquinol (CQ) and inoculation with amyloid-beta42 
      (Aβ42) vaccines have been demonstrated to significantly inhibit deposits of amyloid 
      in AD brains. However, each of these treatments has also been reported to be 
      neurotoxic. The generation of transgenic mice models of AD has made it possible to 
      study aspects of this disease employing experimental animals. In the present study, 
      we investigated the efficacy and toxicity of CQ and Aβ42 vaccine in a transgenic AD 
      (APP/PS1) mouse model. Our results confirmed that both CQ and Aβ42 vaccine were 
      effective in significantly reducing the deposits of amyloid in the brains of 
      transgenic AD mice. We also report here that systemic CQ induces myelinopathies in 
      the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (DLG), which was almost devoid of amyloid 
      plaques and is the primary site of retinal efferent projections via the optic nerve. 
      This is the first report that systemic administration of CQ causes myelinopathies in 
      the central nervous system (CNS) of a transgenic AD mouse model as well as wild-type 
      mice. Inoculation with an Aβ42 vaccine was also found, for the first time, to result 
      in a significant increase in plaque-independent astrocytic hyperplasia in the dorsal 
      part of the lateral septal nucleus (LSD) which was also devoid of plaques, 
      reflecting potential brain inflammatory processes.

TI  - Body mass index and magnetic resonance markers of brain integrity in adults.
PG  - 652-7
LID - 10.1002/ana.21377 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Obesity and being overweight during adulthood have been consistently 
      linked to increased risk for development of dementia later in life, especially 
      Alzheimer's disease. They have also been associated with cognitive dysfunction and 
      brain structural alterations in otherwise healthy adults. Although proton magnetic 
      resonance spectroscopy may distinguish between neuronal and glial components of the 
      brain and may point to neurobiological mechanisms underlying brain atrophy and 
      cognitive changes, no spectroscopic studies have yet assessed the relationships 
      between adiposity and brain metabolites. METHODS: We have utilized magnetic 
      resonance imaging and proton magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging data from 50 
      healthy middle-aged participants (mean age, 41.7 +/- 8.5 years; 17 women), who were 
      scanned as control subjects for another study. RESULTS: After adjustment for age and 
      sex, greater body mass indices (BMIs) correlated with: (1) lower concentrations of 
      N-acetylaspartate (spectroscopic marker of neuronal viability) in frontal (p = 
      0.001), parietal (p = 0.006), and temporal (p = 0.008) white matter; (2) lower 
      N-acetylaspartate in frontal gray matter (p = 0.01); and (3) lower concentrations of 
      choline-containing metabolites (associated with membrane metabolism) in frontal 
      white matter (p = 0.05). INTERPRETATION: These results suggest that increased BMI at 
      midlife is associated with neuronal and/or myelin abnormalities, primarily in the 
      frontal lobe. Because white matter in the frontal lobes is more prone to the effects 
      of aging than in other lobes, our results may reflect accelerated aging in 
      individuals with high levels of adiposity. Thus, greater BMI may increase the odds 
      of developing an age-related disease, such as Alzheimer's disease.

TI  - A recurrent de novo mutation in TMEM106B causes hypomyelinating leukodystrophy.
PG  - 3105-3111
LID - 10.1093/brain/awx314 [doi]
AB  - Hypomyelinating leukodystrophies are a heterogeneous group of disorders with a 
      clinical presentation that often includes early-onset nystagmus, ataxia and 
      spasticity and a wide range of severity. Using next-generation sequencing techniques 
      and GeneMatcher, we identified four unrelated patients with brain hypomyelination, 
      all with the same recurrent dominant mutation, c.754G>A p.(Asp252Asn), in TMEM106B. 
      The mutation was confirmed as de novo in three of the cases, and the mildly affected 
      father of the fourth affected individual was confirmed as mosaic for this variant. 
      The protein encoded by TMEM106B is poorly characterized but is reported to have a 
      role in regulation of lysosomal trafficking. Polymorphisms in TMEM106B are thought 
      to modify disease onset in frontotemporal dementia, but its relation to myelination 
      is not understood. Clinical presentation in three of the four patients is remarkably 
      benign compared to other hypomyelinating disorders, with congenital nystagmus and 
      mild motor delay. These findings add TMEM106B to the growing list of genes causing 
      hypomyelinating disorders and emphasize the essential role lysosomes play in 
      myelination.

TI  - Adult-onset leukoencephalopathy with axonal spheroids and pigmented glia: report on 
      a case with morphometric studies.
PG  - 492-501
LID - 10.5414/NP300603 [doi]
AB  - Two previously distinct leukodystrophies, pigmentary orthochromatic leukodystrophy 
      and hereditary diffuse leukoencephalopathy with spheroids, have recently been 
      interpreted as variants of the same disease, adult-onset leukoencephalopathy with 
      spheroids and pigmented glia (ALSP). We report a sporadic case of a 56-year-old male 
      with ALSP presenting as frontotemporal dementia behavioral variant (FTD-bv). He had 
      a history of depression and developed socially inappropriate behaviors consistent 
      with FTD-bv. His first neurological exam was normal, but he developed new symptoms 
      in the next 1.5 years: executive functional difficulties, anosognosia, urinary 
      incontinence, epilepsy, extrapyramidal syndrome, severe gait disturbance, 
      dysarthria, dysphagia and mutism. He died of pneumonia 20 months after initial 
      presentation. MRI revealed increased T2-FLAIR signal in periventricular white matter 
      and corpus callosum atrophy. Histology showed extensive demyelination of the centrum 
      semiovale, most severe in frontal and temporal lobes, sparing U-fibers. There was no 
      cortical neuronal loss, but selective loss of thalamic neurons. Histopathological 
      hallmarks were cortical neuronal ballooning, white matter orthochromasia, pigmented 
      macrophages, oligodendroglial loss, and axonal spheroids, some myelinated and some 
      vacuolated. Morphometric studies for myelin, spheroids, oligodendrocytes and 
      astrocytes showed that: 1) spheroids were most abundant in areas of partial 
      demyelination rather than areas of extensive demyelination, being absent in normal 
      appearing areas, 2) oligodendrocyte loss only occurred in regions of extensive 
      demyelination and not in partial demyelination, and 3) there was no statistically 
      significant change in number of astrocytes. There were also many more spheroids than 
      physiologically expected in the gracile and cuneate nuclei. These findings suggest 
      that the formation of spheroids is an early-stage event in disease progression.

TI  - Systems analysis of human brain gene expression: mechanisms for HIV-associated 
      neurocognitive impairment and common pathways with Alzheimer's disease.
PG  - 4

AB  - BACKGROUND: Human Immunodeficiency Virus-1 (HIV) infection frequently results in 
      neurocognitive impairment. While the cause remains unclear, recent gene expression 
      studies have identified genes whose transcription is dysregulated in individuals 
      with HIV-association neurocognitive disorder (HAND). However, the methods for 
      interpretation of such data have lagged behind the technical advances allowing the 
      decoding genetic material. Here, we employ systems biology methods novel to the 
      field of NeuroAIDS to further interrogate extant transcriptome data derived from 
      brains of HIV + patients in order to further elucidate the neuropathogenesis of 
      HAND. Additionally, we compare these data to those derived from brains of 
      individuals with Alzheimer's disease (AD) in order to identify common pathways of 
      neuropathogenesis. METHODS: In Study 1, using data from three brain regions in 6 
      HIV-seronegative and 15 HIV + cases, we first employed weighted gene co-expression 
      network analysis (WGCNA) to further explore transcriptome networks specific to HAND 
      with HIV-encephalitis (HIVE) and HAND without HIVE. We then used a symptomatic 
      approach, employing standard expression analysis and WGCNA to identify networks 
      associated with neurocognitive impairment (NCI), regardless of HIVE or HAND 
      diagnosis. Finally, we examined the association between the CNS penetration 
      effectiveness (CPE) of antiretroviral regimens and brain transcriptome. In Study 2, 
      we identified common gene networks associated with NCI in both HIV and AD by 
      correlating gene expression with pre-mortem neurocognitive functioning. RESULTS: 
      Study 1: WGCNA largely corroborated findings from standard differential gene 
      expression analyses, but also identified possible meta-networks composed of multiple 
      gene ontology categories and oligodendrocyte dysfunction. Differential expression 
      analysis identified hub genes highly correlated with NCI, including genes implicated 
      in gliosis, inflammation, and dopaminergic tone. Enrichment analysis identified gene 
      ontology categories that varied across the three brain regions, the most notable 
      being downregulation of genes involved in mitochondrial functioning. Finally, WGCNA 
      identified dysregulated networks associated with NCI, including oligodendrocyte and 
      mitochondrial functioning. Study 2: Common gene networks dysregulated in relation to 
      NCI in AD and HIV included mitochondrial genes, whereas upregulation of various 
      cancer-related genes was found. CONCLUSIONS: While under-powered, this study 
      identified possible biologically-relevant networks correlated with NCI in HIV, and 
      common networks shared with AD, opening new avenues for inquiry in the investigation 
      of HAND neuropathogenesis. These results suggest that further interrogation of 
      existing transcriptome data using systems biology methods can yield important 
      information.

TI  - Distinctive RNA expression profiles in blood associated with white matter 
      hyperintensities in brain.
PG  - 2744-9
LID - 10.1161/STROKEAHA.110.591875 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: White matter hyperintensities (WMH) are areas of high signal 
      detected by T2 and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery sequences on brain MRI. 
      Although associated with aging, cerebrovascular risk factors, and cognitive 
      impairment, the pathogenesis of WMH remains unclear. Thus, RNA expression was 
      assessed in the blood of individuals with and without extensive WMH to search for 
      evidence of oxidative stress, inflammation, and other abnormalities described in WMH 
      lesions in brain. METHODS: Subjects included 20 with extensive WMH (WMH+), 45% of 
      whom had Alzheimer disease, and 18 with minimal WMH (WMH-), 44% of whom had 
      Alzheimer disease. All subjects were clinically evaluated and underwent quantitative 
      MRI. Total RNA from whole blood was processed on human whole genome Affymetrix HU133 
      Plus 2.0 microarrays. RNA expression was analyzed using an analysis of covariance. 
      RESULTS: Two hundred forty-one genes were differentially regulated at ± 1.2-fold 
      difference (P < 0.005) in subjects with WMH+ as compared to WMH-, regardless of 
      cognitive status and 50 genes were differentially regulated with ± 1.5-fold 
      difference (P < 0.005). Cluster and principal components analyses showed that the 
      expression profiles for these genes distinguished WMH+ from WMH- subjects. Function 
      analyses suggested that WMH-specific genes were associated with oxidative stress, 
      inflammation, detoxification, and hormone signaling, and included genes associated 
      with oligodendrocyte proliferation, axon repair, long-term potentiation, and 
      neurotransmission. CONCLUSIONS: The unique RNA expression profile in blood 
      associated with WMH is consistent with roles of systemic oxidative stress and 
      inflammation, as well as other potential processes in the pathogenesis or 
      consequences of WMH.

TI  - Abundant extracellular myelin in the meninges of patients with multiple sclerosis.
PG  - 283-95
LID - 10.1111/j.1365-2990.2008.00986.x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In multiple sclerosis (MS) myelin debris has been observed within MS 
      lesions, in cerebrospinal fluid and cervical lymph nodes, but the route of myelin 
      transport out of the brain is unknown. Drainage of interstitial fluid from the brain 
      parenchyma involves the perivascular spaces and leptomeninges, but the presence of 
      myelin debris in these compartments has not been described. AIMS: To determine 
      whether myelin products are present in the meninges and perivascular spaces of MS 
      patients. METHODS: Formalin-fixed brain tissue containing meninges from 29 MS 
      patients, 9 non-neurological controls, 6 Alzheimer's disease, 5 stroke, 5 meningitis 
      and 7 leucodystrophy patients was investigated, and immunohistochemically stained 
      for several myelin proteins [proteolipid protein (PLP), myelin basic protein (MBP), 
      myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) and 2',3'-cyclic nucleotide 
      3'-phosphodiesterase (CNPase)]. On brain material from MS patients and 
      (non)neurological controls, PLP immunostaining was used to systematically 
      investigate the presence of myelin debris in the meninges, using a semiquantitative 
      scale. RESULTS: Extensive extracellular presence of myelin particles, positive for 
      PLP, MBP, MOG and CNPase in the leptomeninges of MS patients, was observed. Myelin 
      particles were also observed in perivascular spaces of MS patients. 
      Immunohistochemical double-labelling for macrophage and dendritic cell markers and 
      PLP confirmed that the vast majority of myelin particles were located 
      extracellularly. Extracellular myelin particles were virtually absent in meningeal 
      tissue of non-neurological controls, Alzheimer's disease, stroke, meningitis and 
      leucodystrophy cases. CONCLUSIONS: In MS leptomeninges and perivascular spaces, 
      abundant extracellular myelin can be found, whereas this is not the case for 
      controls and other neurological disease. This may be relevant for understanding 
      sustained immunogenicity or, alternatively, tolerogenicity in MS.

PG  - 3649-60
LID - 10.1016/j.molimm.2008.04.025 [doi]
AB  - In the Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain, binding of Clq within the Cl complex, the 
      initiating molecule of the classical complement pathway, to apoptotic cells, DNA and 
      amyloid-beta (Abeta), the major constituent of senile plaques, can initiate 
      complement activation. However, the extent of activation is determined by the 
      balance between activation and inhibition. Fluid-phase complement inhibitor 
      C4b-binding protein (C4BP) was immunohistochemically detected in Abeta plaques and 
      on apoptotic cells in AD brain. In vitro, C4BP bound apoptotic and necrotic but not 
      viable brain cells (astrocytes, neurons and oligodendrocytes) and limited complement 
      activation on dead brain cells. C4BP also bound Abeta1-42 peptide directly, via the 
      C4BP alpha-chain, and limited the extent of complement activation by Abeta. C4BP 
      levels in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of dementia patients and controls were low 
      compared to levels in plasma and correlated with CSF levels of other 
      inflammation-related factors. In conclusion, C4BP binds to dead brain cells and 
      Abeta peptide in vitro, is present in CSF and possibly protects against excessive 
      complement activation in AD brains.

TI  - Trophic factors in cerebrospinal fluid and spinal cord of patients with tropical 
      spastic paraparesis, HIV, and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.
PG  - 248-54
AB  - HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (TSP/HAM) is a chronic CNS 
      disease characterized by axomyelinic degeneration of the long axons of corticospinal 
      tracts. Levels of NGF, NT-3, NT-4/5, BDNF, GDNF, CNTF, and FGF-2 were measured in 
      the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of 21 TSP/HAM patients and 20 controls. NGF, BDNF, and 
      FGF-2 levels were also determined in 19 patients with HIV motor cognitive motor 
      syndrome, and in 21 subjects diagnosed with Creutzfeldt Jakob disease (CJD). No 
      significant differences were detected in the concentrations of NGF, BDNF, NT-3, 
      NT-4/5, GDNF, and CNTF in the CSF between TSP/HAM patients and controls. FGF-2 was 
      significantly lower in the CSF of the three groups of patients compared with 
      controls; the HIV group exhibited the lowest values. HIV patients differed from 
      TSP/HAM in their significantly higher levels of NGF and lower levels of BDNF and 
      FGF-2, whereas CJD patients differed only in their higher levels of NGF. 
      Immunohistochemical studies were done of trophic factors (NGF and FGF-2) and 
      neurotrophin receptors (trkA and p75) in spinal cord and motor cortical areas from 
      anatomopathological cases of TSP/HAM. Results indicated that NGF is expressed in 
      motoneurons and oligodendrocytes of the posterior column of the spinal cord. FGF-2 
      was detected in motoneurons and spinal cord vessels. p75 receptor was detected in 
      cortical neurons. The absence of a significant change in the trophic factor levels 
      in TSP/HAM may be attributed to a selective axonal lesion in a slow process.

TI  - Primary progressive aphasia as the initial manifestation of corticobasal 
      degeneration and unusual tauopathies.
PG  - 419-35
AB  - The clinical, neuroradiological, neuropathological and biochemical findings in four 
      patients with primary progressive aphasia and tauopathy are described. The aphasic 
      syndrome preceded by several years the appearance of other symptoms in every case. 
      Asymmetrical apraxia with alien hand phenomenon occurred in one case. Frontotemporal 
      symptoms occurred in three cases, but progressed to dramatic cognitive devastation 
      in only one of these. Generalized dementia consistent with probable Alzheimer's 
      disease (AD) developed with time in another. Cerebral computer tomography scans, 
      magnetic resonance imaging and SPECT studies revealed marked asymmetries in one 
      case, and showed nonspecific cerebral atrophy in the remaining ones. The 
      neuropathological examination revealed typical corticobasal degeneration (CBD) in 
      one case; CBD and AD in another; and atypical CBD, argyrophilic grain disease (AGD) 
      and alpha-synucleinopathy consistent with Parkinson's disease in a third. Unique 
      neuropathological findings were found in the remaining case. This was characterized 
      by severe cerebral atrophy, marked neuronal loss in the cerebral cortex and abnormal 
      tau deposition in neurons of the cerebral cortex, diencephalon and brain stem. 
      Ballooned neurons, Pick bodies, generalized cortical neurofibrillary tangles and 
      astrocytic plaques were absent. However, massive globular inclusions, containing 
      phospho-tau, occurred in glial cells, mainly oligodendrocytes, in the white matter. 
      Biochemical studies of frontal homogenates revealed four bands of 73/74, 68, 64 and 
      60 kDa of phosphorylated tau (using antibodies recognizing phospho-tau Thr181, 
      Ser262 and Ser422) in the patient with AD and CBD, suggesting a predominant AD 
      pattern in this case. Two bands of 68 and 64 kDa of phospho-tau were recovered in 
      the sarkosyl-insoluble fraction in the other three cases. This pattern is similar to 
      that found in CBD, progressive supranuclear palsy and AGD. Taken together, the 
      present series further supports pure and combined CBD as causes of primary 
      progressive aphasia, and they extend the hypothesis that primary progressive aphasia 
      may be the initial symptom of distinct tauopathies.

TI  - Abnormal Sp1 transcription factor expression in Alzheimer disease and tauopathies.
PG  - 30-4
AB  - Sp1 transcription factor expression was examined by immunohistochemistry, 
      immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy in Alzheimer disease (AD), Pick disease 
      (PiD), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), Parkinson disease (PD) and Dementia 
      with Lewy bodies (DLB). Sp1 partly co-localizes with hyper-phosphorylated tau 
      deposits in neurofibrillary tangles, dystrophic neurites of senile plaques and 
      neuropil threads in AD, and in neurons, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes bearing 
      hyper-phosphorylated tau in PiD and PSP. Sp1 is not found in alpha-synuclein 
      inclusions in PD and DLB. These modifications are not associated with changes in the 
      total expression levels of Sp1, as revealed with gel electrophoresis and Western 
      blotting of brain homogenates. Furthermore, no co-immunoprecipitation of Sp1 and 
      phospho-tau was observed in AD and PiD cases. Since Sp1 binding sites are present in 
      the promoters of several genes involved in amyloid and tau, and Sp1 is regulated by 
      oxidative stress, the present findings suggest that Sp1 deposition in 
      hyper-phosphorylated tau deposits may have functional consequences in the pathology 
      of AD and other tauopathies.

TI  - Subcellular Changes in Bridging Integrator 1 Protein Expression in the Cerebral 
      Cortex During the Progression of Alzheimer Disease Pathology.
PG  - 779-790
AB  - Genome-wide association studies have established BIN1 (Bridging Integrator 1) as the 
      most significant late-onset Alzheimer disease (AD) susceptibility locus after APOE 
      We analyzed BIN1 protein expression using automated immunohistochemistry on the 
      hippocampal CA1 region in 19 patients with either no, mild, or moderate-to-marked AD 
      pathology, who had been assessed by Clinical Dementia Rating and CERAD scores. We 
      also examined the amygdala, prefrontal, temporal, and occipital regions in a subset 
      of these patients. In non-demented controls without AD pathology, BIN1 protein was 
      expressed in white matter, glia, particularly oligodendrocytes, and in the neuropil 
      in which the BIN1 signal decorated axons. With increasing severity of AD, BIN1 in 
      the CA1 region showed: 1) sustained expression in glial cells, 2) decreased areas of 
      neuropil expression, and 3) increased cytoplasmic neuronal expression that did not 
      correlate with neurofibrillary tangle load. In patients with AD, both the prefrontal 
      cortex and CA1 showed a decrease in BIN1-immunoreactive (BIN1-ir) neuropil areas and 
      increases in numbers of BIN1-ir neurons. The numbers of CA1 BIN1-ir pyramidal 
      neurons correlated with hippocampal CERAD neuritic plaque scores; BIN1 neuropil 
      signal was absent in neuritic plaques. Our data provide novel insight into the 
      relationship between BIN1 protein expression and the progression of AD-associated 
      pathology and its diagnostic hallmarks.

TI  - alpha-Synuclein forms a complex with transcription factor Elk-1.
PG  - 239-52
AB  - alpha-Synuclein has been identified as a component of Lewy bodies in Parkinson's 
      disease and diffuse Lewy body disease, and glial cytoplasmic inclusions (GCIs) in 
      multiple system atrophy (MSA). To explore the role of alpha-synuclein in the 
      pathogenesis, we searched for molecules interacting with alpha-synuclein and 
      discovered that GCIs are stained by anti-Elk-1 antibody. To seek the role of Elk-1 
      in synucleinopathies, we cotransfected alpha-synuclein and Elk-1 to cultured cells, 
      and found small granular structure complexes where the two molecules colocalized. 
      Moreover, alpha-synuclein and Elk-1 were co-immunoprecipitated from the cell 
      lysates. For formation of the complex, the presence of both ETS and B-box domains of 
      Elk-1 was required. Although there was no evidence of direct binding between 
      alpha-synuclein and Elk-1, we discovered that alpha-synuclein and Elk-1 both bind to 
      ERK-2, a MAP kinase. The effect of alpha-synuclein on the MAP kinase pathway was 
      assessed using the Pathdetect system, which showed prominent attenuation of Elk-1 
      phosphorylation with alpha-synuclein, and especially A53T mutant. Our results 
      suggest that alpha-synuclein reacts with the MAP kinase pathway, which might cause 
      dysfunction of neurons and oligodendrocytes and lead to neurodegeneration in 
      Parkinson's disease and MSA.

TI  - Alterations in glia and axons in the brains of Binswanger's disease patients.
PG  - 1423-9
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Although increasing attention is being paid to Binswanger's 
      disease, a form of vascular dementia characterized by diffuse white matter lesions, 
      only limited information is available on the pathological changes that occur in the 
      glia and axons in the white matter. We therefore investigated the brains of patients 
      with Binswanger's disease to gain further insight into its pathophysiology. METHODS: 
      Autopsied brains from patients with Binswanger's disease (group 3; n = 17) were 
      compared with those of nonneurological controls (group 1; n = 5) and controls with 
      large cortical infarcts but without significant white matter lesions (group 2; n = 
      5). Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) was used as an immunohistochemical marker 
      for astroglia, leukocyte common antigen (LCA) was used as a marker for microglia, 
      and HLA-DR was used as a marker for activated microglia. Axonal damage was assessed 
      by the accumulation of proteins, which are transported by fast axonal flow, amyloid 
      protein precursor (APP), synaptophysin, and chromogranin A. RESULTS: Although there 
      was no difference in numerical density of GFAP-immunoreactive astroglia in each 
      group, regressive astroglia were observed in 7 of 17 patients with Binswanger's 
      disease. LCA-immunoreactive microglia were 1.7 times more numerous in Binswanger's 
      disease than in group 1 (P < .05). HLA-DR-immunoreactive-activated microglia were 
      3.4 times and 2.1 times more numerous in Binswanger's disease as compared with group 
      1 (P < .01) and group 2 (P < .05), respectively. There was frequent perivascular 
      lymphocyte cuffing, and clusters of macrophages with a decreased number of 
      oligodendroglia were observed in the rarefied white matter. The grading scores for 
      the number of axons immunoreactive for either APP, synaptophysin, or chromogranin A 
      were significantly higher in Binswanger's disease than in group 1 or 2. CONCLUSIONS: 
      The pathological alterations in Binswanger's diseased brains include regressive 
      changes in the astroglia and activation of the microglia with a decrease in the 
      oligodendroglia, which were associated with the degradation of both myelin and 
      axonal components. These results indicate that an inflammatory reaction and 
      compromised axonal transport, mediated by chronic ischemia, may play an important 
      role in the pathophysiology of Binswanger's disease.

TI  - Focal demyelination in Alzheimer's disease and transgenic mouse models.
PG  - 567-77
LID - 10.1007/s00401-010-0657-2 [doi]
AB  - We have investigated alterations in myelin associated with Abeta plaques, a major 
      pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD), in human tissue and relevant 
      transgenic mice models. Using quantitative morphological techniques, we determined 
      that fibrillar Abeta pathology in the grey matter of the neocortex was associated 
      with focal demyelination in human presenilin-1 familial, sporadic and preclinical AD 
      cases, as well as in two mouse transgenic models of AD, compared with age-matched 
      control tissue. This demyelination was most pronounced at the core of Abeta plaques. 
      Furthermore, we found a focal loss of oligodendrocytes in sporadic and preclinical 
      AD cases associated with Abeta plaque cores. In human and transgenic mice alike, 
      plaque-free neocortical regions showed no significant demyelination or 
      oligodendrocyte loss compared with controls. Dystrophic neurites associated with the 
      plaques were also demyelinated. We suggest that such plaque-associated focal 
      demyelination of the cortical grey matter might impair cortical processing, and may 
      also be associated with aberrant axonal sprouting that underlies dystrophic neurite 
      formation.

TI  - A histochemical study of iron, transferrin, and ferritin in Alzheimer's diseased 
      brains.
PG  - 75-83
AB  - Immunohistochemical and histochemical staining were performed on Alzheimer's 
      diseased brain tissue obtained at autopsy. The iron-regulatory proteins transferrin 
      and ferritin as well as iron are, in general, found predominantly in 
      oligodendrocytes similar to that previously reported for normal brain tissue. 
      However, in the vicinity of senile plaques, the staining pattern is altered for both 
      proteins and iron. Transferrin is homogenously distributed around the senile plaques 
      and is apparently extracellular. In addition, transferrin is found in astrocytes in 
      the cerebral cortical white matter of the Alzheimer's tissue rather than its normal 
      distribution in oligodendrocytes. A robust ferritin immunoreaction accompanies 
      senile plaques and many blood vessels in the Alzheimer's brain tissue. Although many 
      ferritin-positive oligodendrocytes are present in the Alzheimer's tissue, most of 
      the ferritin-containing cells associated with senile plaques and blood vessels are 
      microglia. Iron can also be demonstrated in the senile plaques. The iron reaction 
      product is observed both diffusely in proximity of the plaques and in cells 
      associated with the plaques. These data strongly suggest a disruption in brain iron 
      homeostasis in Alzheimer's disease as demonstrated by alterations in the normal 
      cellular distribution of iron and the proteins responsible for iron regulation. 
      These data will contribute to understanding both the potential for oxidative damage 
      and the potential for metal neurotoxicity in Alzheimer's disease.

TI  - Vulnerability of select neuronal types to Alzheimer's disease.
PG  - 53-61
AB  - From a morphological perspective, Alzheimer's disease (AD) is primarily a 
      degenerative disorder of the neuronal cytoskeleton involving lipofuscin-laden 
      cortical projection neurons with long, thin, and sparsely myelinated axons. The 
      neocortical primary fields, relatively small in extent but functionally 
      sophisticated, exhibit an early and brief myelination cycle, whereas the much more 
      expansive but relatively simply organized association areas undergo a late and 
      prolonged myelination process. The greater the degree of myelination and the less 
      intense the pigmentation, the more resistant a given projection neuron may be to 
      oxidative stress as well as to the development of AD-related neurofibrillary changes 
      and vice versa. The neurofibrillary pathology commences from those cortical areas 
      that are less completely myelinated and gradually progresses to the most 
      functionally developed cortical fields that display the highest degree of 
      myelination, thereby reflecting a hierarchy in the susceptibility of diverse 
      cortical areas to the evolution of the AD-associated cytoskeletal pathology.

TI  - White matter lesion progression: a surrogate endpoint for trials in cerebral 
      small-vessel disease.
PG  - 139-44
AB  - There is neuropathologic evidence that confluent MRI white matter lesions in the 
      elderly reflect ischemic brain damage due to microangiopathy. The authors 
      hypothesize that measuring changes in the progression of white matter lesions as 
      shown by MRI may provide a surrogate marker in clinical trials on cerebral 
      small-vessel disease in which the currently used primary outcomes are cognitive 
      impairment and dementia. This hypothesis is based on evidence that confluent white 
      matter lesions progress rapidly as shown in a recent follow-up study in 
      community-dwelling subjects. The mean increase in lesion volume was 5.2 cm(3) after 
      3 years. Based on these data in a clinical trial, 195 subjects with confluent 
      lesions would be required per treatment arm to demonstrate a 20% reduction in the 
      rate of disease progression over a 3-year period. Like any other MRI metric, the 
      change in white matter lesion volume cannot be considered preferable to clinical 
      outcomes unless it has been demonstrated that it matters to the patient in terms of 
      function.

TI  - In vivo evidence of cerebellar atrophy and cerebral white matter loss in Huntington 
      disease.
PG  - 989-95
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the regional pattern of white matter and cerebellar 
      changes, as well as subcortical and cortical changes, in Huntington disease (HD) 
      using morphometric analyses of structural MRI. METHODS: Fifteen individuals with HD 
      and 22 controls were studied; groups were similar in age and education. Primary 
      analyses defined six subcortical regions, the gray and white matter of primary 
      cortical lobes and cerebellum, and abnormal signal in the cerebral white matter. 
      RESULTS: As expected, basal ganglia and cerebral cortical gray matter volumes were 
      significantly smaller in HD. The HD group also demonstrated significant cerebral 
      white matter loss and an increase in the amount of abnormal signal in the white 
      matter; occipital white matter appeared more affected than other cerebral white 
      matter regions. Cortical gray and white matter measures were significantly related 
      to caudate volume. Cerebellar gray and white matter volumes were both smaller in HD. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The cerebellum and the integrity of cerebral white matter may play a 
      more significant role in the symptomatology of HD than previously thought. 
      Furthermore, changes in cortical gray and cerebral white matter were related to 
      caudate atrophy, supporting a similar mechanism of degeneration.

AB  - Previously, we demonstrated that allopregnanolone (APα) promoted proliferation of 
      rodent and human neural progenitor cells in vitro. Further, we demonstrated that APα 
      promoted neurogenesis in the hippocampal subgranular zone (SGZ) and reversed 
      learning and memory deficits in the male triple transgenic mouse model of 
      Alzheimer's (3xTgAD). In the current study, we determined the efficacy of APα to 
      promote the survival of newly generated neural cells while simultaneously reducing 
      Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology in the 3xTgAD male mouse model. Comparative 
      analyses between three different APα treatment regimens indicated that APα 
      administered 1/week for 6 months was maximally efficacious for simultaneous 
      promotion of neurogenesis and survival of newly generated cells and reduction of AD 
      pathology. We further investigated the efficacy of APα to impact Aβ burden. 
      Treatment was initiated either prior to or post intraneuronal Aβ accumulation. 
      Results indicated that APα administered 1/week for 6 months significantly increased 
      survival of newly generated neurons and simultaneously reduced Aβ pathology with 
      greatest efficacy in the pre-pathology treatment group. APα significantly reduced Aβ 
      generation in hippocampus, cortex, and amygdala, which was paralleled by decreased 
      expression of Aβ-binding-alcohol-dehydrogenase. In addition, APα significantly 
      reduced microglia activation as indicated by reduced expression of OX42 while 
      increasing CNPase, an oligodendrocyte myelin marker. Mechanistic analyses indicated 
      that pre-pathology treatment with APα increased expression of liver-X-receptor, 
      pregnane-X-receptor, and 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA-reductase (HMG-CoA-R), 
      three proteins that regulate cholesterol homeostasis and clearance from brain. 
      Together these findings provide preclinical evidence for the optimal treatment 
      regimen of APα to achieve efficacy as a disease modifying therapeutic to promote 
      regeneration while simultaneously decreasing the pathology associated with 
      Alzheimer's disease.

TI  - White matter changes in old age dementia.
PG  - 197-207
AB  - This is the clinico-morphological study of 70 patients above age 60 with the 
      clinical diagnosis of dementia made on clinico-psychometric criteria for the 
      assessment of the deterioration-dementia state, and in some cases, using the 
      Hachinski scale. For morphological macro- and microscopic examinations of the brain, 
      the classic neuropathologic techniques were used. Although no case selection was 
      carried out, the number of cases was uniformly distributed between the ages of 60-74 
      years. The sample was also relatively uniform with regard to the patients' sex. 
      Morphologically, our patient group included cases with vascular dementia (VD-33%), 
      mixed dementia (MD-14.3%), Alzheimer-type dementia (ATD-20%), isolated SAE (17%), 
      other cases (15.7%). Myelinic pallors and rarefactions were present in 41.4% of all 
      cases of which: as a single lesion in 41.4%, associated with VD in 34.5%, with MD in 
      17.2% and with ATD in 6.9%. Microscopic background of myelinic changes was 
      represented by acute (perivascular and pericellular edema) and chronic (myelinic 
      destruction, gliosis, perivascular hematic pigment) edematous lesions. In 10.3% of 
      cases with myelinic changes, marked dilation and blood stasis in large 
      periventricular and/or subcortical vessels with subsequent cerebral edema, generally 
      overlapping critical zones of venous circulation could be observed. The size and 
      severity of the myelinic lesions were not clearly correlated to the intra- and 
      extraparenchymatous vascular changes. However, the myelinic involvement was more in 
      cases with lesions, mainly atherosclerotic, of the vessel walls. The possible 
      intervention of the venous factor in the development of subcortical arteriosclerotic 
      encephalopathy (SAE) is discussed among other etiopathogenic factors.

TI  - Study of the localization of iron, ferritin, and hemosiderin in Alzheimer's disease 
      hippocampus by analytical microscopy at the subcellular level.
PG  - 42-54
AB  - Previous studies of the structure of core nanocrystals of ferritin (Ft) in the 
      brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) have shown differences in the 
      mineral compound in comparison with physiological Ft. Both Ft cores have a 
      polyphasic composition but whereas the major phase in physiological Ft is hexagonal 
      ferric iron oxide (ferrihydrite), the major phases in brain AD Ft are two cubic 
      mixed ferric-ferrous iron oxides (magnetite and wüstite). One of these (wüstite) is 
      similar to what is detected in hemosiderin (Hm) cores in primary hemochromatosis 
      (Quintana, C., Cowley, J.M, Marhic, C., 2004. Electron nanodiffraction and high 
      resolution electron microscopy studies of the structure and composition of 
      physiological and pathological ferritin. J. Struct. Biol. 147, 166-178). We have 
      studied, herein, the distribution of iron, Ft, and Hm in sections of AD hippocampus 
      using analytical microscopy. Iron present in Ft cores was directly mapped in a 
      nanoSIMS microscope and the iron distribution has been correlated with the 
      constituent elements N, P, and S. Ft and Hm cores were visualized at an 
      ultrastructural level in an analytical transmission electron microscope. In senile 
      plaques, Ft was observed in the coronal region associated with a non-beta-amyloid 
      component and in the periphery of plaques, together with Hm, in sulfur-rich dense 
      bodies of dystrophic neurites. Hm was also found in lysosomes and siderosomes of 
      glial cells. Ft was observed in the cytoplasm and nucleus of oligodendrocytes. Ft 
      was particularly abundant in myelinated axons in association with oligodendrocyte 
      processes. These findings provide new arguments to support the hypothesis of a 
      dysfunction of Ft (with eventual degradation to Hm) in AD resulting in an increase 
      of toxic brain ferrous ions that may contribute to the production of free radicals 
      that induce both cellular oxidative stress and aged-related myelin breakdown 
      associated with cognitive decline and AD (Bartzokis, G., 2004. Age-related myelin 
      breakdown: a developmental model of cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease. 
      Neurobiol. Aging 25, 5-18).

TI  - White matter lesions impair frontal lobe function regardless of their location.
PG  - 246-53
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To analyze the effect of white matter lesions in different brain regions 
      on regional cortical glucose metabolism, regional cortical atrophy, and cognitive 
      function in a sample with a broad range of cerebrovascular disease and cognitive 
      function. METHODS: Subjects (n = 78) were recruited for a study of subcortical 
      ischemic vascular disease (SIVD) and Alzheimer disease (AD) contributions to 
      dementia. A new method was developed to define volumes of interest from 
      high-resolution three-dimensional T1-weighted MR images. Volumetric measures of MRI 
      segmented white matter signal hyperintensities (WMH) in five different brain regions 
      were related to regional PET glucose metabolism (rCMRglc) in cerebral cortex, MRI 
      measures of regional cortical atrophy, and neuropsychological assessment of 
      executive and memory function. RESULTS: WMH was significantly higher in the 
      prefrontal region compared to the other brain regions. In all subjects, higher 
      frontal and parietal WMH were associated with reduced frontal rCMRglc, whereas 
      occipitotemporal WMH was only marginally associated with frontal rCMRglc. These 
      associations were stronger and more widely distributed in nondemented subjects where 
      reduced frontal rCMRglc was correlated with WMH for all regions measured. In 
      contrast, there was no relationship between WMH in any brain region and rCMRglc in 
      either parietal or occipitotemporal regions. WMHs in all brain regions were 
      associated with low executive scores in nondemented subjects. CONCLUSIONS: The 
      frontal lobes are most severely affected by SIVD. WMHs are more abundant in the 
      frontal region. Regardless of where in the brain these WMHs are located, they are 
      associated with frontal hypometabolism and executive dysfunction.

TI  - Neurological signs and frontal white matter lesions in vascular parkinsonism. A 
      clinicopathologic study.
PG  - 965-9
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The clinical characteristics and the pathological lesions of 
      so-called vascular parkinsonism (VP) are still debatable. The purpose of this study 
      was to define the core signs and symptoms and assess the cerebrovascular lesions in 
      pathologically confirmed VP. METHODS: In the present study, VP was defined as the 
      presence of parkinsonism and pathological evidence of cerebrovascular lesions but no 
      depigmentation or Lewy bodies at the substantia nigra. We compared the clinical 
      signs and symptoms of 24 VP patients with those of 30 age-matched patients with 
      pathologically confirmed Parkinson's disease. We compared the brain pathology in VP 
      patients with that in 22 age-matched patients with Binswanger's disease (BD) who had 
      no parkinsonism according to clinical records. RESULTS: VP was characterized 
      clinically by a short-stepped or frozen gait, lead-pipe rigidity, absence of resting 
      tremor, and negative response to levodopa. Half or more of VP patients demonstrated 
      pyramidal tract signs and pseudobulbar palsies. There was no significant difference 
      in the extent of vascular lesions at the basal ganglia between patients with VP and 
      with BD without parkinsonism. The extent of frontal white matter pallor tended to be 
      less broad in VP than in BD without parkinsonism. In VP patients, the number of 
      oligodendrocytes in the frontal white matter was significantly less than that in 
      age-matched normal control subjects and significantly more than in those with BD. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The core signs and symptoms of autopsy-proved VP differ from those of 
      typical Parkinson's disease, and most VP patients had diffuse cerebral white matter 
      lesions as well as basal ganglia lesions. VP might be related to frontal white 
      matter lesions.

TI  - Apoptosis of astrocytes with enhanced lysosomal activity and oligodendrocytes in 
      white matter lesions in Alzheimer's disease.
PG  - 238-51
AB  - Cerebral white matter lesions in Alzheimer's disease (AD) consist of subcortical 
      degeneration and ischaemic-hypoxic changes. Glial changes are intimately associated 
      with the white matter lesions, and regressive changes in astrocytes and loss of 
      oligodendroglial cells have been reported. We quantitatively compared glial changes 
      including apoptosis and enhanced lysosomal activity in the frontal and temporal 
      white matter by using terminal dUTP nick end labelling (TUNEL) and 
      immunohistochemistry for glial markers, lysosomes and apoptosis-regulating proteins 
      in non-familial AD brains. The degree of myelin pallor and axonal loss varied 
      considerably in both the frontal and temporal white matter but fibrillary gliosis in 
      demyelinated lesions tended to be less prominent in the temporal white matter in AD 
      cases. A morphometric study with planimetric methods for cross-sectional areas of 
      frontal and temporal white matter revealed that the white matter of AD cases 
      manifested atrophy with significant reduction in frontal (11.9%) and temporal 
      (29.4%) white matter compared to normal controls. Double immunolabelling for glial 
      fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and KP1 (CD68) revealed KP1-positive fragmented 
      structures within the weakly GFAP-labelled astrocytes. These KP1-positive structures 
      correspond to process fragmentation and cytoplasmic vacuoles, which in turn indicate 
      enhanced lysosomal activity during regressive changes in astrocytes. The 
      KP1-modified astrocytes were not found in Pick's disease and corticobasal 
      degeneration. The density of apoptotic glial cells, largely oligodendroglial, was 
      significantly higher in the temporal than in the frontal white matter, and most 
      GFAP-positive astrocytes with regressive changes were apoptotic. GFAP-positive 
      astrocyte density was statistically the same in the frontal and temporal white 
      matter, but the density of KP1-modified astrocytes was higher in the temporal than 
      in the frontal white matter. The rate of white matter shrinkage was significantly 
      correlated with the density of apoptotic glial cells and the density of KP1-modified 
      astrocytes in the temporal lobe in AD cases. An increase in apoptotic glial cell 
      density was found to contribute to GFAP-positive astrocytes with regressive changes 
      in temporal white matter, while apoptosis of vascular smooth muscle cells did not 
      show topographical accentuation. Astrocytes labelled with beta amyloid protein were 
      not apoptotic, and the density of apoptotic cells labelled with CD95 and caspase-3 
      was too low in both types of white matter to be statistically evaluated. Our results 
      imply that regressive changes in astrocytes and glial apoptosis are, to some extent, 
      associated with white matter lesions, particularly of the temporal lobe in AD 
      brains. The presence of apoptotic astrocytes with evidence of regressive change 
      could therefore be a histological hallmark for white matter degeneration in AD.

TI  - Myelin injury and degraded myelin vesicles in Alzheimer's disease.
PG  - 232-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Myelin disruption is an important feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD) 
      that contributes to impairment of neuronal circuitry and cognition. In this study we 
      characterize myelin degradation in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease 
      compared with normal aged controls. METHODS: Myelin from patients with AD (n=13) was 
      compared to matched controls (n=6). Myelin degradation was examined by 
      immunohistochemistry in frontal white matter (WM) for intact myelin basic protein 
      (MBP), degraded MBP, the presence of myelin lipid and for PAS staining. The 
      relationship of myelin degradation and axonal injury was also assessed. RESULTS: 
      Brains from patients with AD had significant loss of intact MBP, and an increase in 
      degraded MBP in periventricular WM adjacent to a denuded ependymal layer. In regions 
      of myelin degradation, vesicles were identified that stained positive for degraded 
      MBP, myelin lipid, and neurofilament but not for intact MBP. Most vesicles stained 
      for PAS, a corpora amylacea marker. The vesicles were significantly more abundant in 
      the periventricular WM of AD patients compared to controls (44.5 ± 11.0 versus 1.7 ± 
      1.1, p=0.02). CONCLUSION: In AD patients degraded MBP is associated in part with 
      vesicles particularly in periventricular WM that is adjacent to areas of ependymal 
      injury.

TI  - CSF T-Tau/Aβ42 predicts white matter microstructure in healthy adults at risk for 
      Alzheimer's disease.
PG  - e37720

AB  - Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers T-Tau and Aβ(42) are linked with Alzheimer's 
      disease (AD), yet little is known about the relationship between CSF biomarkers and 
      structural brain alteration in healthy adults. In this study we examined the extent 
      to which AD biomarkers measured in CSF predict brain microstructure indexed by 
      diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and volume indexed by T1-weighted imaging. 
      Forty-three middle-aged adults with parental family history of AD received baseline 
      lumbar puncture and MRI approximately 3.5 years later. Voxel-wise image analysis 
      methods were used to test whether baseline CSF Aβ(42), total tau (T-Tau), 
      phosphorylated tau (P-Tau) and neurofilament light protein predicted brain 
      microstructure as indexed by DTI and gray matter volume indexed by T1-weighted 
      imaging. T-Tau and T-Tau/Aβ(42) were widely correlated with indices of brain 
      microstructure (mean, axial, and radial diffusivity), notably in white matter 
      regions adjacent to gray matter structures affected in the earliest stages of AD. 
      None of the CSF biomarkers were related to gray matter volume. Elevated P-Tau and 
      P-Tau/Aβ(42) levels were associated with lower recognition performance on the Rey 
      Auditory Verbal Learning Test. Overall, the results suggest that CSF biomarkers are 
      related to brain microstructure in healthy adults with elevated risk of developing 
      AD. Furthermore, the results clearly suggest that early pathological changes in AD 
      can be detected with DTI and occur not only in cortex, but also in white matter.

TI  - Relationships between arteriosclerosis, cerebral amyloid angiopathy and myelin loss 
      from cerebral cortical white matter in Alzheimer's disease.
PG  - 46-56
AB  - Pathological relationships between damage to the deep white matter of the cerebral 
      cortex [as evidenced by myelin loss (ML)], cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) and 
      arteriosclerosis (ART) were investigated in the brains of 137 patients with 
      autopsy-confirmed Alzheimer's disease (AD), in order to better understand the causes 
      of white matter damage in AD, and the contribution of this to the pathogenesis of 
      the disorder. All 137 patients had some degree of CAA in one or more brain regions 
      although the occipital cortex was severely affected by CAA more frequently, and 
      consequently mean CAA severity score was significantly greater, than other cortical 
      regions. Eighty-seven patients (63.5%) were affected by ML, with more patients 
      showing ML from occipital cortex than from other cortical regions leading to a 
      significantly higher mean ML severity score in this region. One hundred and 
      twenty-six patients (92%) were affected by ART, although the occipital cortex was 
      not more frequently affected by ART than other cortical areas, the mean ART severity 
      score in occipital cortex was nonetheless significantly greater than that of frontal 
      and temporal cortex. Eighty-seven patients showed both CAA and ML, although there 
      was only a weak correlation between degree of CAA and extent of ML (P = 0.035). 
      Forty-seven patients showed ML and significant ART, 16 patients showed significant 
      ART but no ML, 40 patients showed ML in the absence of significant ART and 34 
      patients showed neither significant ART nor ML. Overall, and for each of the four 
      brain regions, the extent of ML correlated significantly (P < 0.001) with degree of 
      ART. However, when only those 47 patients with ML and significant ART were 
      considered, much stronger correlations between the extent of ML and the degree of 
      ART were achieved both overall and within each of the four brain regions. The 
      overall ART severity score (and overall scores for each pathological marker of ART) 
      significantly correlated with that of CAA (P < 0.001). Pathological processes 
      leading to white matter damage, in terms of ML at least, in AD are thus likely to be 
      heterogeneous. Many patients suffer ML in association with ART, but in others ML 
      cannot be explained by presence of ART or CAA. In such patients, autoregulatory 
      changes in blood vessels might be responsible for ML. The association between the 
      extent of CAA and ART suggests shared risk factors for each pathological change.

TI  - Glycogen synthase kinase-3 is associated with neuronal and glial hyperphosphorylated 
      tau deposits in Alzheimer's disease, Pick's disease, progressive supranuclear palsy 
      and corticobasal degeneration.
PG  - 583-91
AB  - Tau phosphorylation was examined in Alzheimer's disease (AD), Pick's disease (PiD), 
      progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and corticobasal degeneration (CBD) using 
      phospho-specific tau antibodies recognizing the phosphorylated form of Ser202, 
      Ser214 and Ser 396, and antibodies to non-phosphorylated glycogen synthase 
      kinase-3alpha/beta (GSK-3alpha/beta), which regulates phosphorylation at these 
      specific sites on tau and phosphorylated GSK-3betaSer9 (GSK-3beta-P); this antibody 
      is directed to the inactive form of GSK-3beta. Phospho-specific tau antibodies 
      recognized disease-specific band patterns on Western blots of sarcosyl-insoluble 
      fractions: four bands of 73, 68, 64 and 60 kDa in AD, two bands of 68 and 64 kDa in 
      PSP and CBD, and two bands of 64 and 60 kDa in PiD. Moreover, anti-phospho-tau 
      Ser202, Ser214 and Ser369 decorated neurons with neurofibrillary tangles, dystrophic 
      neurites of senile plaques, neuropil threads, Pick bodies, astrocytes and 
      oligodendrocytes with coiled bodies. No differences in the expression of 
      GSK-3alpha/beta were seen between neurons with and without neurofibrillary tangles. 
      GSK-3alpha/beta was enriched in sarcosyl-insoluble fractions, suggesting association 
      of this kinase with tau hyperphosphorylation. In addition, strong expression of the 
      phosphorylated form of GSK-3beta was found in a subpopulation of neurons with 
      neurofibrillary tangles, and in dystrophic neurites of senile plaques, neuropil 
      threads, Pick bodies, tau-containing astrocytes and coiled bodies in AD, PiD, PSP 
      and CBD. This was not due to cross-reactivity between GSK-3 and phospho-tau. 
      Specific bands differing from those of phospho-tau were seen on Western blots of 
      sarcosyl-insoluble fractions processed for GSK-3alpha/beta and GSK-3beta-P. 
      Double-labeling immunohistochemistry discloses that GSK-3beta-P co-localizes with 
      abnormal tau in about 50% of neurons with neurofibrillary tangles, and in neuronal 
      processes, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes in various tauopathies. The present 
      results support a pivotal role for GSK-3 in tau phosphorylation in neurons and glial 
      cells. Moreover, the elevated number of tau-containing cells stained with 
      anti-GSK-3beta-P antibodies suggests a partial inactivation of the kinase, or 
      sequestration of the phosphorylated form, which may contribute to the regulation of 
      the cascade of tau hyperphosphorylation in tauopathies, and to protect 
      tau-containing cells from apoptosis.

TI  - Differential expression of cholesterol hydroxylases in Alzheimer's disease.
PG  - 34674-81
AB  - Cholesterol is eliminated from neurons by oxidization, which generates oxysterols. 
      Cholesterol oxidation is mediated by the enzymes cholesterol 24-hydroxylase 
      (CYP46A1) and cholesterol 27-hydroxylase (CYP27A1). Immunocytochemical studies show 
      that CYP46A1 and CYP27A1 are expressed in neurons and some astrocytes in the normal 
      brain, and CYP27A1 is present in oligodendrocytes. In Alzheimer's disease (AD), 
      CYP46A1 shows prominent expression in astrocytes and around amyloid plaques, whereas 
      CYP27A1 expression decreases in neurons and is not apparent around amyloid plaques 
      but increases in oligodendrocytes. Although previous studies have examined the 
      effects of synthetic oxysterols on the processing of amyloid precursor protein 
      (APP), the actions of the naturally occurring oxysterols have yet to be examined. To 
      understand the role of cholesterol oxidation in AD, we compared the effects of 
      24(S)- and 27-hydroxycholesterol on the processing of APP and analyzed the 
      cell-specific expression patterns of the two cholesterol hydroxylases in the human 
      brain. Both oxysterols inhibited production of Abeta in neurons, but 
      24(S)-hydroxycholesterol was approximately 1000-fold more potent than 
      27-hydroxycholesterol. The IC(50) of 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol for inhibiting Abeta 
      secretion was approximately 1 nm. Both oxysterols induced ABCA1 expression with 
      IC(50) values similar to that for inhibition of A beta secretion, suggesting the 
      involvement of liver X receptor. Oxysterols also inhibited protein kinase C activity 
      and APP secretion following stimulation of protein kinase C. The selective 
      expression of CYP46A1 around neuritic plaques and the potent inhibition of APP 
      processing in neurons by 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol suggests that CYP46A1 affects the 
      pathophysiology of AD and provides insight into how polymorphisms in the CYP46A1 
      gene might influence the pathophysiology of this prevalent disease.

TI  - [Neuropathologic markers in degenerative dementias].
PG  - S50-64
AB  - The number of neuropathological markers used for the diagnosis of degenerative 
      dementias is rapidly increasing, and this is somewhat confusing: some lesions 
      described a long time ago, such as ballooned cells, proved to be less specific than 
      they were supposed to be; this is also the case for Lewy bodies, that have been 
      recognised in a larger spectrum of disorders than thought a few years ago. On the 
      contrary, for an increasing number of neuropathologists, Pick bodies are now 
      mandatory for the diagnosis of Pick disease, and this contrasts with the prevalent 
      opinions of the late sixties or seventies. There are a number of reasons for the 
      changing significance of neuropathological markers. Three of them can be easily 
      identified: 1) the burst of immunohistochemistry into neuropathology allowed an 
      easier recognition, a better delineation and new pathophysiological approaches to 
      old lesions, and a dramatic increase in the description of new markers, especially 
      in glial cells; 2) in some conditions characterized by the number and distribution 
      of some lesions rather than by their mere presence, such as aging and Alzheimer 
      disease, a better neuroanatomical point of view permitted new insights into the 
      concept of disease versus age-related changes; 3) more accurate clinicopathologic 
      correlations showed clearly the need of grouping or lumping together some entities: 
      for example, obvious relationship aroused between progressive supranuclear palsy and 
      corticobasal degeneration; in contrast, distinguishing different disorders in the 
      frontal lobe dementias grouped together into "Pick disease" was felt necessary. This 
      review summarizes the main criteria for identification, and the presumed meaning of 
      the chief markers indicating the presence of abnormally phosphorylated tau proteins, 
      A beta peptides, and PrP proteins. Abnormally phosphorylated tau proteins can be 
      stored in the neurons, and participate in the constitution of many lesions 
      (neurofibrillary tangles, neuropil threads, abnormal processes of the crown of 
      neuritic senile plaques, Pick bodies, granulo-vacuolar degeneration, argyrophilic 
      grains). When seen in neuroglia, they are the chief constituents of various lesions 
      that affect mainly astrocytes (abnormal tufts of fibres, astrocytic plaques, 
      thorn-shaped astrocytes, spiny astrocytes) and also oligodendrocytes 
      (oligodendroglial threads and coils, glial cytoplasmic inclusions). A beta peptides, 
      in "preamyloid" and amyloid conformations, can be seen in the extracellular space 
      (plaques, of the neuritic or non-neuritic varieties, diffuse, focal and granular 
      deposits) and in the vascular walls (amyloid angiopathies). Some PrP deposits are 
      also of the amyloid variety (kuru type, multicentric or florid plaques), but 
      immunohistochemistry, far more sensitive than conventional studies, revealed a 
      number of other lesions (perivacuolar, neuronal, "synaptic" deposits...). Numerous 
      markers are easily detected by ubiquitin immunohistochemistry. Lewy bodies, Pick 
      bodies, neurofibrillary tangles had already be identified by other methods. In 
      contrast, some ubiquitin-positive inclusions are shown, by this technique only, in 
      amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and other conditions which were thus related to this 
      disease. Finally, this review deals with two classic markers, ballooned cells ("Pick 
      cells") and spongiosis seen in disorders due to non conventional agents or prions 
      (spongiform encephalopathies).

AB  - Psychotic symptoms are common in individuals with Alzheimer's disease (AD), and 
      define a phenotype associated with more rapid cognitive and functional decline. 
      Evidence suggests that psychotic symptoms may be influenced by genetic factors, and 
      recent studies in schizophrenia, bipolar affective disorder (BPAD) and Alzheimer's 
      disease with psychosis (AD+P) suggest that psychosis susceptibility or modifier 
      genes may act across diseases. We hypothesised that oligodendrocyte lineage 
      transcription factor 2 (OLIG2), a regulator of white matter development and a 
      candidate gene for schizophrenia, may also be associated with psychotic symptoms in 
      AD. We genotyped 11 SNPs in OLIG2 previously tested for association with 
      schizophrenia [L. Georgieva, V. Moskvina, T. Peirce, N. Norton, N.J. Bray, L. Jones,

      these for association with AD and AD+P. Significant evidence for association of 
      psychotic symptoms within cases was identified for two SNPs, rs762237 (allelic 
      P=0.002, OR=1.42, corrected P=0.019) and rs2834072 (allelic P=0.004, OR=1.41,

AB  - BACKGROUND: Accumulation of β-amyloid peptides is an important hallmark of 
      Alzheimer's disease (AD). Tremendous efforts have been directed to elucidate the 
      mechanisms of β-amyloid peptides degradation and develop strategies to remove 
      β-amyloid accumulation. In this study, we demonstrated that a subpopulation of 
      oligodendroglial precursor cells, also called NG2 cells, were a new cell type that 
      can clear β-amyloid peptides in the AD transgene mice and in NG2 cell line. RESULTS: 
      NG2 cells were recruited and clustered around the amyloid plaque in the 
      APPswe/PS1dE9 mice, which is Alzheimer's disease mouse model. In vitro, NG2 cell 
      line and primary NG2 cells engulfed β-amyloid peptides through the mechanisms of 
      endocytosis in a time dependent manner. Endocytosis is divided into pinocytosis and 
      phagocytosis. Aβ(42) internalization by NG2 cells was mediated by actin-dependent 
      macropinocytosis. The presence of β-amyloid peptides stimulated the autophagic 
      pathway in NG2 cells. Once inside the cells, the β-amyloid peptides in NG2 cells 
      were transported to lysosomes and degraded by autophagy. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings 
      suggest that NG2 cells are a new cell type that can clear β-amyloid peptides through 
      endocytosis and autophagy.

TI  - Decreased brain levels of 2',3'-cyclic nucleotide-3'-phosphodiesterase in Down 
      syndrome and Alzheimer's disease.
PG  - 547-53
AB  - In Down syndrome (DS) as well as in Alzheimer's disease (AD) oligodendroglial and 
      myelin alterations have been reported. 2',3'-cyclic nucleotide-3'-phosphodiesterase 
      (CNPase) and carbonic anhydrase II (CA II) are widely accepted as markers for 
      oligodendroglia and myelin. However, only data on CNPase activity have been 
      available in AD and DS brains so far. In our study we determined the protein levels 
      of CNPase and CA II in DS, AD and in control post mortem brain samples in order to 
      assess oligodendroglia and myelin alterations in both diseases. We used two 
      dimensional electrophoresis to separate brain proteins that were subsequently 
      identified by matrix assisted laser desorption and ionization mass-spectroscopy 
      (MALDI-MS). Seven brain areas were investigated (frontal, temporal, occipital and 
      parietal cortex, cerebellum, thalamus and caudate nucleus). In comparison to control 
      brains we detected significantly decreased CNPase protein levels in frontal and 
      temporal cortex of DS patients. The level of CA II protein in DS was unchanged in 
      comparison to controls. In AD brains levels of CNPase were decreased in frontal 
      cortex only. The level of CA II in all brain areas in AD group was comparable to 
      controls. Changes of CNPase protein levels in DS and AD are in agreement with the 
      previous finding of decreased CNPase activity in DS and AD brain. They probably 
      reflect decreased oligodendroglial density and/or reduced myelination. These can be 
      secondary to disturbances in axon/oligodendroglial communication due to neuronal 
      loss present in both diseases. Alternatively, reduced CNPase levels in DS brains may 
      be caused by impairment of glucose metabolism and/or alterations of thyroid 
      functions.

AB  - Using 7T T2(⁎)-weighted imaging, we scanned post-mortem hemispheres of Alzheimer 
      patients and age-matched controls to describe the patterns of appearance of cortical 
      lamination on T2*-weighted MRI in the medial temporal lobe and to assess the changes 
      in Alzheimer patients versus controls. While controls showed a hypointense line of 
      Baillarger in the majority of the cases, appearance of cortical lamination varied to 
      a greater extent in the Alzheimer patients. Severely distorted cortical lamination 
      was also observed in advanced stage Alzheimer patients and presented itself as a 
      broad hypointense inhomogeneous band, covering a large part of the cortical width. 
      Histology indicated that the changes in the appearance of visible cortical 
      lamination were not only associated with myelin changes, but also with diffuse 
      cortical iron alterations and depositions. Therefore, imaging cortical lamination 
      alterations in Alzheimer patients using T2*-weighted MRI might provide new 
      information on involved neuroanatomical structures in an advanced neurodegenerative 
      stage.

PG  - 459-74
AB  - Three patients aged 63, 63 and 74 years had various combinations of progressive 
      lower and upper motor neuron dysfunction, sensory loss, urinary incontinence and 
      dementia. Postmortem examinations in two cases showed moderate cerebral and spinal 
      atrophy, ill-defined areas of incomplete myelin loss in white matter and small 
      necrotic foci in the white matter of gyri, around the basal ganglia and near the 
      dentate nuclei. The main microscopic abnormality was a massive accumulation of 
      PAS-positive polyglucosan bodies (PB) of various sizes and shapes in the cerebral 
      hemispheres, brainstem, cerebellum, spinal cord, nerve roots and nerves. These PB 
      were found in the processes of nerve cells and astrocytes, but not in their 
      perikarya. Similar PB were present in peripheral nerves and in the lungs, heart, 
      liver and kidneys. In the third case, a nerve biopsy revealed several, unusually 
      large, PB in the axons of myelinated fibers. These clinicopathologic features are 
      consistent with adult polyglucosan body disease (APBD) and are distinctive from 
      other conditions in which PB may accumulate. Twelve similar cases have been reported 
      previously. The diagnosis can be made by nerve biopsy. The pathogenesis of APBD is 
      not known, but it may be a polysaccharide storage disease.

AB  - Using analytical microscopies we have observed an increase of Fe(2+) iron-induced 
      oxidative stress inside pathological ferritin (Ft). This finding, together with the 
      presence of Ft in myelinated axons associated with oligodendrocyte processes and 
      myelin sheet fraying, suggests that a dysfunction of ferritin (a ferritinopathy) may 
      be the non-specific aging-dependent pathogenic event responsible for 
      neurodegenerative disease.

TI  - Ultrastructural characteristics of tau filaments in tauopathies: immuno-electron 
      microscopic demonstration of tau filaments in tauopathies.
PG  - 475-83
AB  - The microtubule-associated protein tau aggregates into filaments in the form of 
      neurofibrillary tangles, neuropil threads and argyrophilic grains in neurons, in the 
      form of variable astrocytic tangles in astrocytes and in the form of coiled bodies 
      and argyrophilic threads in oligodendrocytes. These tau filaments may be classified 
      into two types, straight filaments or tubules with 9-18 nm diameters and "twisted 
      ribbons" composed of two parallel aligned components. In the same disease, the fine 
      structure of tau filaments in glial cells roughly resembles that in neurons. In 
      sporadic tauopathies, individual tau filaments show characteristic sizes, shapes and 
      arrangements, and therefore contribute to neuropathologic differential diagnosis. In 
      frontotemporal dementias caused by tau gene mutations, variable filamentous profiles 
      were observed in association with mutation sites and insoluble tau isoforms, 
      including straight filaments or tubules, paired helical filament-like filaments, and 
      twisted ribbons. Pre-embedding immunoelectron microscopic studies were carried out 
      using anti-3-repeat tau and anti-4-repeat tau specific antibodies, RD3 and RD4. 
      Straight tubules in neuronal and astrocytic Pick bodies were immunolabeled by the 
      anti-3-repeat tau antibody. The anti-4-repeat tau antibody recognized abnormal 
      tubules comprising neurofibrillary tangles, coiled bodies and argyrophilic threads 
      in progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and corticobasal degeneration. In the 
      pre-embedding immunoelectron microscopic study using the phosphorylated tau AT8 
      antibody, tuft-shaped astrocytes of PSP were found to be composed of bundles of 
      abnormal tubules in processes and perikarya of protoplasmic astrocytes. In this 
      study, the 3-repeat tau or 4-repeat tau epitope was detected in situ at the 
      ultrastructural level in abnormal tubules in representative pathological lesions in 
      Pick's disease, PSP and corticobasal degeneration.

TI  - Differential modulation of cell death proteins in human brain cells by tumor 
      necrosis factor alpha and platelet activating factor.
PG  - 530-8
AB  - Programmed cell death contributes to the morbidity and mortality of several 
      neurological disorders including stroke, Alzheimer's disease and human 
      immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-associated dementia. Patients with HIV dementia show 
      evidence of programmed cell death in brain. In vitro data demonstrates several 
      neurotoxic products of macrophage infection that cause neural cell death, including 
      tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) and platelet activating factor (PAF). We 
      treated human brain aggregate cultures with these cytokines and determined their 
      effect on the mRNA and protein levels for Bcl-2, Bcl(x) and Bax alpha. TNFalpha and 
      PAF differentially regulate the Bcl-2 family of proteins at a post-transcriptional 
      level. Following TNFalpha treatment, Bcl-2 protein is significantly decreased, and 
      at least one additional Bax isomer emerges. Bcl(xL) protein is slightly increased 
      after treatment with either cytokine. We demonstrated that overexpression of Bcl-2 
      in brain aggregate cultures protects cells from TNFalpha-induced damage but has no 
      effect on cell damage induced by PAF. We conclude that Bcl-2 and Bax alpha proteins 
      play significant roles in modulating neural cell death from TNFalpha- but not from 
      PAF-induced cell damage.

TI  - Glial fibrillary acidic protein is a major target of glycoxidative and lipoxidative 
      damage in Pick's disease.
PG  - 177-85
AB  - Pick's disease is a subset of fronto-temporal dementia characterised by severe 
      atrophy of the temporal and frontal lobes due to marked neuronal loss accompanied by 
      astrocytic gliosis enriched in glial acidic protein. The remaining neurones have 
      intracytoplasmic inclusions composed of hyperphosphorylated tau, called Pick bodies, 
      in addition to hyperphosphorylated tau in astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. Gel 
      electrophoresis and western blotting using markers of glycoxidation (advanced 
      glycation end products, N-carboxyethyl-lysine and N-carboxymethyl-lysine: AGE, CEL, 
      CML, respectively) and lipoxidation (4-hydroxy-2-nonenal: HNE, and 
      malondialdehyde-lysine: MDAL) were used in the frontal and occipital cortex in three 
      Pick's disease cases and three age-matched controls. In Pick's disease, increased 
      AGE, CML, CEL, HNE and MDAL bands of about 50 kDa were observed in the frontal 
      cortex (but not in the occipital cortex) in association with increased density of 
      glial acidic protein bands. Bi-dimensional gel electrophoresis and western blotting 
      also disclosed increased amounts and numbers of glial acidic protein isoforms in the 
      frontal cortex in Pick's disease. Moreover, redox proteomics showed glycoxidation, 
      as revealed with anti-CEL antibodies and lipoxidation using anti-HNE antibodies, of 
      at least three glial acidic protein isoforms. The present results demonstrate that 
      glial acidic protein is a target of oxidative damage in the frontal cortex in Pick's 
      disease.

TI  - Mechanisms of cell death in neurodegenerative disorders.
PG  - 95-114
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Progressive cell loss in specific neuronal populations is the prominent 
      pathological hallmark of neurodegenerative diseases, but its molecular basis remains 
      unresolved. Apoptotic cell death has been implicated as a general mechanism in 
      Alzheimer disease (AD) and other neurodegenerative disorders. However, DNA 
      fragmention in neurons is too frequent to account for the continuous loss in these 
      slowly progressive diseases. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In 9 cases of morphologically 
      confirmed AD (CERAD criteria, Braak stages 5 or 6), 5 cases of Parkinson disease 
      (PD) and 3 cases each of Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), Progressive Supranuclear 
      Palsy (PSP), and Multiple System Atrophy (MSA), and 7 age-matched controls, the 
      TUNEL method was used to detect DNA fragmentation, and immunohistochemistry for an 
      array of apoptosis-related proteins (ARP), protooncogenes, and activated caspase-3 
      were performed. RESULTS: In AD, a considerable number of hippocampal neurons showed 
      DNA fragmentation with a 3 to 5.7 fold increase related to neurofibrillary tangles 
      and amyloid deposits, but only exceptional neurons displayed apoptotic morphology (1 
      in 1100-5000) and cytoplasmic immunoreactivity for ARPs and activated caspase-3 (1 
      in 2600 to 5650 hippocampal neurons), whereas no neurons were labeled in age-matched 
      controls. Caspase-3 immunoreactivity was seen in granules of granulovacuolar 
      degeneration, only rarely colocalized with tau-immunoreactivity. In PD, DLB, and 
      MSA, TUNEL positivity and expression of ARPs or activated caspase-3 was only seen in 
      microglia, rare astrocytes and in oligodendroglia with cytoplasmic inclusions in 
      MSA, but not in nigral or other neurons with or without Lewy bodies. In PSP, only 
      single neurons but oligodendrocytes, some with tau deposits, in brainstem tegmentum 
      and pontine nuclei were TUNEL-positive and expressed both ARPs and activated 
      caspase-3. CONCLUSIONS: These data provide evidence for extremely rare apoptotic 
      neuronal death in AD compatible with the progression of neuronal degeneration in 
      this chronic disease. In other neurodegenerative disorders, apoptosis mainly 
      involves microglia and oligodendroglia, while alternative mechanisms of neuronal 
      death may occur. Susceptible cell populations in a proapoptotic environment show 
      increased vulnerability towards metabolic and other pathogenic factors, with 
      autophagy as a possible protective mechanism in early stages of programmed cell 
      death. The intracellular cascade leading to cell death still awaits elucidation.

TI  - Incipient Alzheimer's disease: microarray correlation analyses reveal major 
      transcriptional and tumor suppressor responses.
PG  - 2173-8
AB  - The pathogenesis of incipient Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been resistant to 
      analysis because of the complexity of AD and the overlap of its early-stage markers 
      with normal aging. Gene microarrays provide new tools for addressing complexity 
      because they allow overviews of the simultaneous activity of multiple cellular 
      pathways. However, microarray data interpretation is often hindered by low 
      statistical power, high false positives or false negatives, and by uncertain 
      relevance to functional endpoints. Here, we analyzed hippocampal gene expression of 
      nine control and 22 AD subjects of varying severity on 31 separate microarrays. We 
      then tested the correlation of each gene's expression with MiniMental Status 
      Examination (MMSE) and neurofibrillary tangle (NFT) scores across all 31 subjects 
      regardless of diagnosis. These well powered tests revealed a major transcriptional 
      response comprising thousands of genes significantly correlated with AD markers. 
      Several hundred of these genes were also correlated with AD markers across only 
      control and incipient AD subjects (MMSE > 20). Biological process categories 
      associated with incipient AD-correlated genes were identified statistically (ease 
      program) and revealed up-regulation of many transcription factor/signaling genes 
      regulating proliferation and differentiation, including tumor suppressors, 
      oligodendrocyte growth factors, and protein kinase A modulators. In addition, 
      up-regulation of adhesion, apoptosis, lipid metabolism, and initial inflammation 
      processes occurred, and down-regulation of protein folding/metabolism/transport and 
      some energy metabolism and signaling pathways took place. These findings suggest a 
      new model of AD pathogenesis in which a genomically orchestrated up-regulation of 
      tumor suppressor-mediated differentiation and involution processes induces the 
      spread of pathology along myelinated axons.

TI  - White matter lesions and hippocampal atrophy in Alzheimer's disease.
PG  - 310-2
AB  - White matter lesions (WML) and hippocampal atrophy (HA) on MRI commonly co-occur in 
      Alzheimer's disease (AD) and are thought to play a role in the etiology of AD. It is 
      still not known whether WML and HA are independent or related. The authors 
      investigated the relation between WML and HA in 179 patients with probable AD who 
      had a cerebral MRI. A linear relation was found between WML and HA, especially for 
      WML in the frontal and parieto-occipital regions. The results suggest that vascular 
      pathology and typical AD pathology (HA) are related.

TI  - Autosomal dominant leukodystrophy with axonal spheroids and pigmented glia: clinical 
      and neuropathological characteristics.
PG  - 39-45
AB  - We report two autopsy cases of siblings with adult-onset autosomal dominant 
      leukodystrophy characterized by destruction of cerebral white matter, large numbers 
      of axonal spheroids and pigmented glia in the fronto-temporal lobes. Both patients 
      presented with motor and cognitive symptoms and aphasia, 2-3 years before death. At 
      autopsy, the brain showed brown coloration and decreased volume of white matter in 
      the frontal and temporal lobes as well as corpus callosum. Microscopically, marked 
      loss of myelin and axons and abundant axonal spheroids without apparent neuronal 
      loss were observed in the frontal and temporal lobes, which was consistent with 
      hereditary diffuse leukodystrophy with spheroids (HDLS). In addition, glial cells, 
      most consistent with macrophages and containing pigments that were stained by Sudan 
      III and PAS, were found in the white matter lesions. The present cases showed 
      overlapping features with HDLS and pigmentary type of orthochromatic leukodystrophy, 
      suggesting that the pathomechanisms of these two diseases are closely related.

TI  - Association between apolipoprotein E e4 allele and arteriosclerosis, cerebral 
      amyloid angiopathy, and cerebral white matter damage in Alzheimer's disease.
PG  - 696-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association between white matter damage, as evidenced 
      by myelin loss (ML), the extent of cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), or 
      arteriosclerosis (Art), and apolipoprotein E (ApoE) e4 allele in Alzheimer's disease 
      (AD), in order to understand the causes of damage to white matter in AD and its 
      contribution to the pathogenesis of the disorder. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Brain 
      tissues were obtained from 94 patients with AD confirmed by autopsy. ApoE genotyping 
      was performed by PCR on DNA extracted from frontal cortex or cerebellum. CAA and Art 
      were assessed on Weigert's haematoxylin and eosin stained sections in frontal, 
      temporal, parietal, and occipital cortices; the extent of ML was scored on Luxol 
      fast blue stained sections of these regions. RESULTS: The ApoE e4 allele frequency 
      in the 61 patients with ML was not significantly different from that in the 33 
      patients without ML, nor did this differ in the 84 patients with Art from that in 
      the 10 patients without Art. There were no significant differences in the 
      proportions of patients with genotypes containing 0, 1, or 2 ApoE e4 alleles in the 
      presence or absence of ML or Art. The mean ML, Art, or CAA scores within each 
      region, and the total scores summed across all four brain regions, did not differ 
      between patients with 0, 1, or 2 ApoE e4 alleles. However, the mean ML severity 
      score in the occipital cortex was significantly greater than that in the frontal or 
      temporal cortices in patients with 1 or 2 ApoE e4 alleles. The severity of CAA in 
      the occipital cortex was significantly higher than that in other areas of cortex in 
      patients with 0 or 2 ApoE e4 alleles. The mean Art score in the occipital cortex was 
      greater than that in the temporal cortex in patients with two ApoE e4 alleles and 
      was higher than that in the frontal cortex in patients with one ApoE e4 allele. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The likelihood of patients with AD suffering from CAA, Art, or ML is 
      not influenced by ApoE e4 allele, nor is the overall burden of these pathological 
      changes in the brain. However, the distribution of ML, CAA, and Art within the brain 
      is at least partly influenced by genotype and dosage of ApoE e4 allele, with the 
      occipital cortex being more severely affected by all of these pathological changes 
      in e4 allele bearers, particularly when two ApoE e4 alleles are present.

TI  - Quantitative analysis of the detergent-insoluble brain proteome in frontotemporal 
      lobar degeneration using SILAC internal standards.
PG  - 2721-38
LID - 10.1021/pr2010814 [doi]
AB  - A hallmark of neurodegeneration is the aggregation of disease related proteins that 
      are resistant to detergent extraction. In the major pathological subtype of 
      frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), modified TAR-DNA binding protein 43 
      (TDP-43), including phosphorylated, ubiquitinated, and proteolytically cleaved 
      forms, is enriched in detergent-insoluble fractions from post-mortem brain tissue. 
      Additional proteins that accumulate in the detergent-insoluble FTLD brain proteome 
      remain largely unknown. In this study, we used proteins from stable isotope-labeled 
      (SILAC) human embryonic kidney 293 cells (HEK293) as internal standards for peptide 
      quantitation across control and FTLD insoluble brain proteomes. Proteins were 
      identified and quantified by liquid-chromatography coupled with tandem mass 
      spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and 21 proteins were determined to be enriched in FTLD using 
      SILAC internal standards. In parallel, label-free quantification of only the 
      unlabeled brain derived peptides by spectral counts (SC) and G-test analysis 
      identified additional brain-specific proteins significantly enriched in disease. 
      Several proteins determined to be enriched in FTLD using SILAC internal standards 
      were not considered significant by G-test due to their low total number of SC. 
      However, immunoblotting of FTLD and control samples confirmed enrichment of these 
      proteins, highlighting the utility of SILAC internal standard to quantify 
      low-abundance proteins in brain. Of these, the RNA binding protein PTB-associated 
      splicing factor (PSF) was further characterized because of structural and functional 
      similarities to TDP-43. Full-length PSF and shorter molecular weight fragments, 
      likely resulting from proteolytic cleavage, were enriched in FTLD cases. 
      Immunohistochemical analysis of PSF revealed predominately nuclear localization in 
      control and FTLD brain tissue and was not associated with phosphorylated pathologic 
      TDP-43 neuronal inclusions. However, in a subset of FTLD cases, PSF was aberrantly 
      localized to the cytoplasm of oligodendrocytes. These data raise the possibility 
      that PSF directed RNA processes in oligodendrocytes are altered in neurodegenerative 
      disease.

TI  - [Efficacy of traditional herbal medicine, Yokukansan on patients with neuropathic 
      pain].
PG  - 1248-55
AB  - BACKGROUND: Neuropathic pain that is the chronic, severe, and intractable pain, 
      interferes with activities of daily living (ADL) and consequently reduces quality of 
      life (QOL). We reported the efficacy of Yokukansan in patients with neuropathic 
      pain, including acute herpetic pain, postherpetic neuralgia, central poststroke 
      pain, post-traumatic spinal cord injury pain, thalamic syndrome, complex regional 
      pain syndrome and symptomatic trigeminal neuralgia. Yokukansan was more effective 
      compared with traditional medicines, such as tricyclic antidepressants, 
      carbamazepine, gabapentin, and opioids etc., which are recommended to treat 
      neuropathic pain. Recently, effects of Yokukansan is reported on the behavioral and 
      psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) in elderly patients with dementia. 
      Repeated administration of Yokukansan decreases expression of 5-hydroxytryptamine 
      (5-HT) 2A receptors in the prefrontal cortex in mice, and Yokukansan also protects 
      destruction of myelin sheaths in rats with thiamine deficient-induced 
      encephalopathy. Mechanism of effectiveness of Yokukansan on neuropathic pain has not 
      been established; however, efficacy of Yokukansan on neuropathic pain has been shown 
      clinically. CONCLUSIONS: As far as we know, this is the first report that Yokukansan 
      was effective on neuropathic pain. Yokukansan without serious adverse reactions may 
      be a possible medicine for treatment of neuropathic pain in future.

TI  - Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor enhances viral load in human brain 
      tissue: amelioration with stavudine.
PG  - 413-20
AB  - BACKGROUND: Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) is elevated in 
      cerebrospinal fluid in HIV- associated dementia; in addition, therapeutic GM-CSF 
      elevates plasma viral load. OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of GM-CSF on viral 
      replication and the potential ameliorative effect of antiretroviral therapy. DESIGN: 
      A primary human brain aggregate system is used as a model of the in vivo situation. 
      METHOD: Cultured aggregates were infected with the macrophage tropic strain 
      HIV-1SF162 and then exposed to varying GM-CSF concentrations and 0.3 micromol/l 
      stavudine. Viral replication was assessed by p24 expression in the supernatant and 
      aggregates. Immunohistochemistry identified neurons, astrocytes, microglia and 
      oligodendrocytes. RESULTS: A GM-CSF concentration of 1 ng/ml resulted in a fivefold 
      increase in microglial cells, the main HIV cellular reservoir (P = 0.0001). Prior 
      GM-CSF exposure before infection of the aggregates resulted in sixfold increase in 
      p24 levels compared with non-GM-CSF-exposed infected aggregates. Infected aggregates 
      with or without GM-CSF had significant neuronal loss of 50% and 45%, respectively, 
      and astrocytosis. Addition of stavudine to the infected aggregates, even in the 
      presence of GM-CSF, reduced p24 levels to zero and prevented neuronal loss and 
      astrocytosis. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that GM-CSF enhances viral 
      replication while addition of stavudine prevents this potentially detrimental 
      process.

TI  - Vascular risk factors and leuko-araiosis.
PG  - 42-7
AB  - Leuko-araiosis was found in 49 of 140 demented patients compared with 12 out of 110 
      control subjects. Thirty-one of 95 patients with dementia of the Alzheimer's type 
      had leuko-araiosis. A history of stroke was four times more frequent in patients 
      with leuko-araiosis than in those without leuko-araiosis (17.4% and 4.4%, 
      respectively). It occurred in 25% of controls with leuko-araiosis compared with only 
      2% of those without leuko-araiosis. Mean systolic blood pressure was associated with 
      leuko-araiosis. No association was found for diastolic blood pressure, myocardial 
      infarction, angina, diabetes, or carotid bruits. On logistic regression analysis, 
      the strong association between dementia and leuko-araiosis was mainly explained by a 
      history of stroke. There are common factors in leuko-araiosis and stroke, but stroke 
      alone does not account for leuko-araiosis.

TI  - Peroxiredoxin 6 in human brain: molecular forms, cellular distribution and 
      association with Alzheimer's disease pathology.
PG  - 611-22
LID - 10.1007/s00401-008-0373-3 [doi]
AB  - Peroxiredoxin 6 is an antioxidant enzyme and is the 1-cys member of the 
      peroxiredoxin family. Using two-dimensional electrophoresis and Western blotting, we 
      have shown for the first time that, in human control and brain tissue of patient's 
      with Alzheimer's disease (AD), this enzyme exists as three major and five minor 
      forms with pIs from 5.3 to 6.1. Using specific cellular markers, we have shown that 
      peroxiredoxin 6 is present in astrocytes with very low levels in neurons, but not 
      detectable in microglia or oligodendrocytes. In control brains, there was a very low 
      level of peroxiredoxin 6 staining in astrocytes that was confined to a "halo" around 
      the nucleus. In AD, there were marked increases in the number and staining intensity 
      of peroxiredoxin 6 positive astrocytes in both gray and white matter in the 
      midfrontal cortex, cingulate, hippocampus and amygdala. Confocal microscopy using 
      antibodies to A beta peptide, tau and peroxiredoxin 6 showed that peroxiredoxin 6 
      positive astrocytes are closely involved with diffuse plaques and to a lesser extent 
      with neuritic plaques, suggesting that plaques are producing reactive oxygen 
      species. There appeared to be little astrocytic response to tau containing neurons. 
      Although peroxiredoxin 6 positive astrocytes were seen to make multiple contacts 
      with tau positive neurons, there was no intraneuronal colocalization. In brain 
      tissue of patients with AD, many blood vessels exhibited peroxiredoxin 6 staining 
      that appeared to be due to the astrocytic foot processes. These results suggest that 
      oxidative stress conditions exist in AD and that peroxiredoxin 6 is an important 
      antioxidant enzyme in human brain defenses.

PG  - T58-65
LID - 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2009.02.004 [doi]
AB  - Fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) 
      techniques have been widely used to evaluate white matter (WM) alterations 
      associated with aging, dementia and cerebral vascular disease. The relationship 
      between FLAIR detected WM lesions (WML) and DTI detected WM integrity changes, 
      however, remains unclear. To investigate this association, voxelwise correlations 
      between 4 Tesla DTI and FLAIR images from elderly subjects were performed by 
      relating WML volume and intensity in FLAIR to fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean 
      diffusivity (MD) in DTI. Significant DTI-FLAIR correlations were found in regions 
      overlapping with the WML of moderate intensities in FLAIR. No significant 
      correlations were detected in periventricular regions where the FLAIR intensities 
      are particularly high. The findings are consistent with a transitional model for WM 
      degeneration from normal WM to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The results show that the 
      correlation between DTI and FLAIR disappears when the FLAIR intensity of WML reaches 
      its maximum at a certain lesion severity, and that the correlations may remerge with 
      reversed signs when the lesion severity is further increased. These results suggest 
      that the different stages of WM degeneration in elderly subjects can be better 
      characterized by regional DTI-FLAIR correlations than single modality alone.

PG  - 415-28
LID - 10.1007/s00401-011-0857-4 [doi]
AB  - A number of recent studies have described cases with tau-positive globular 
      oligodendroglial inclusions (GOIs) and such cases have overlapping pathological 
      features with progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), but present with clinical 
      features of motor neuron disease (MND) and/or frontotemporal dementia (FTD). These 
      two clinical phenotypes have been published independently and as a result, have come 
      to be considered as distinct disease entities. We describe the clinicopathological 
      and biochemical features of two cases with GOIs: one with clinical symptoms 
      suggestive of MND and the other with FTD. Histological changes in our two cases were 
      consistent with their clinical symptoms; the MND case had severe neurodegeneration 
      in the primary motor cortex and corticospinal tract, whereas the FTD case had severe 
      involvement of the frontotemporal cortices and associated white matter. 
      Immunohistochemistry in both cases revealed significant 4-repeat (4R) tau pathology 
      primarily in the form of GOIs, but also in astrocytes and neurons. Astrocytic tau 
      pathology was morphologically similar to that seen in PSP, but in contrast was 
      consistently negative for Gallyas silver staining. Tau-specific western blotting 
      revealed 68, 64 and 35 kDa bands, showing further overlap with PSP. The underlying 
      neuropathological features of these two cases were similar, with the major 
      difference relating to the regional distribution of pathology and resulting clinical 
      symptoms and signs. The globular nature of glial inclusions and the non-fibrillar 
      properties of tau in astrocytes are characteristic features that allow them to be 
      distinguished from PSP and other tauopathies. We, therefore, propose the term 
      globular glial tauopathy as an encompassing term to classify this emerging class of 
      4R tauopathy.

TI  - Peroxisomal alterations in Alzheimer's disease.
PG  - 271-83
LID - 10.1007/s00401-011-0836-9 [doi]
AB  - In Alzheimer's disease (AD), lipid alterations are present early during disease 
      progression. As some of these alterations point towards a peroxisomal dysfunction, 
      we investigated peroxisomes in human postmortem brains obtained from the 
      cohort-based, longitudinal Vienna-Transdanube Aging (VITA) study. Based on the 
      neuropathological Braak staging for AD on one hemisphere, the patients were grouped 
      into three cohorts of increasing severity (stages I-II, III-IV, and V-VI, 
      respectively). Lipid analyses of cortical regions from the other hemisphere revealed 
      accumulation of C22:0 and very long-chain fatty acids (VLCFA, C24:0 and C26:0), all 
      substrates for peroxisomal β-oxidation, in cases with stages V-VI pathology compared 
      with those modestly affected (stages I-II). Conversely, the level of plasmalogens, 
      which need intact peroxisomes for their biosynthesis, was decreased in severely 
      affected tissues, in agreement with a peroxisomal dysfunction. In addition, the 
      peroxisomal volume density was increased in the soma of neurons in gyrus frontalis 
      at advanced AD stages. Confocal laser microscopy demonstrated a loss of peroxisomes 
      in neuronal processes with abnormally phosphorylated tau protein, implicating 
      impaired trafficking as the cause of altered peroxisomal distribution. Besides the 
      original Braak staging, the study design allowed a direct correlation between the 
      biochemical findings and the amount of neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) and neuritic 
      plaques, quantified in adjacent tissue sections. Interestingly, the decrease in 
      plasmalogens and the increase in VLCFA and peroxisomal volume density in neuronal 
      somata all showed a stronger association with NFT than with neuritic plaques. These 
      results indicate substantial peroxisome-related alterations in AD, which may 
      contribute to the progression of AD pathology.

TI  - Localization of HIV-1 in human brain using polymerase chain reaction/in situ 
      hybridization and immunocytochemistry.
PG  - 705-11
AB  - Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infects the brains of a majority of 
      patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), and has been linked to 
      the development of a progressive dementia termed "HIV-associated dementia." This 
      disorder results in severe cognitive, behavioral, and motor deficits. Despite this 
      neurological dysfunction, HIV-1 infection of brain cells does not occur 
      significantly in neurons, astrocytes, or oligodendrocytes, but is restricted to 
      brain macrophages and microglia. To identify possible low-level or latent infection 
      of other brain cells, we combined the techniques of the polymerase chain reaction 
      with in situ hybridization for the detection of HIV DNA, and used 
      immunocytochemistry to identify the HIV-expressing cells. In the 21 adult brains 
      studied (15 AIDS and 6 seronegative control brains), we found that polymerase chain 
      reaction/in situ hybridization was both sensitive and specific for identifying 
      HIV-infected cells. In all brains, the majority of infected cells were macrophages 
      and microglia. In several brains, however, a substantial minority of cells harboring 
      HIV DNA were identified as astrocytes. Neurons, oligodendrocytes, and endothelial 
      cells were not infected with HIV, even in cases with HIV-associated dementia. These 
      findings confirm previous data regarding the importance of macrophage/microglial 
      infection, and essentially exclude neuronal infection in pathogenetic models of 
      HIV-associated neurological disease. These data also demonstrate that latent or 
      low-level infection of astrocytes occurs in AIDS, a finding that may be of 
      importance in understanding HIV neuropathogenesis.

AB  - Neuronal regeneration and axonal re-growth in the injured mammalian central nervous 
      system remains an unsolved field. To date, three myelin-associated proteins [Nogo or 
      reticulon 4 (RTN4), myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG) and oligodendrocyte myelin 
      glycoprotein (OMG)] are known to inhibit axonal regeneration via activation of the 
      neuronal glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored Nogo receptor [NgR, together with p75 
      neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR) and Lingo-1]. In the present study we describe the 
      novel protein MANI (myelin-associated neurite-outgrowth inhibitor) that localizes to 
      neural membranes. Functional characterization of MANI overexpressing neural stem 
      cells (NSCs) revealed that the protein promotes differentiation into 
      catecholaminergic neurons. Yeast two-hybrid screening and co-immunoprecipitation 
      experiments confirmed the cell division cycle protein 27 (Cdc27) as an interacting 
      partner of Mani. The analyses of Mani-overexpressing PC12 cells demonstrated that 
      Mani retards neuronal axonal growth as a positive effector of Cdc27 expression and 
      activity. We show that knockdown of Cdc27, a component of the anaphase-promoting 
      complex (APC), leads to enhanced neurite outgrowth. Our finding describes the novel 
      MANI-Cdc27-APC pathway as an important cascade that prevents neurons from extending 
      axons, thus providing implications for the potential treatment of neurodegenerative 
      diseases.

TI  - Alpha B crystallin and HSP28 are enhanced in the cerebral cortex of patients with 
      Alzheimer's disease.
PG  - 203-8
AB  - The localization of two small heat shock proteins, alpha B crystallin and 28-kDa 
      heat shock protein (HSP28), was studied immunochemically and immunohistochemically 
      in cerebral cortex of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and control groups. By 
      specific immunoassays for alpha B crystallin and HSP28, we found that the 
      concentrations of alpha B crystallin are elevated in the temporal and frontal lobes, 
      while those of HSP28 are elevated in the temporal, frontal, and parietal lobes in 
      the AD brains. Immunohistochemically, alpha B crystallin was localized in astrocytes 
      and oligodendrocytes, while HSP28 was present in degenerating neurons in the 
      cerebral cortex of both AD and control brains. However, alpha B 
      crystallin-immunoreactive astrocytes and HSP28-immunoreactive degenerating neurons 
      were more frequently observed in AD brains. The immunoreactivity for HSP28 was also 
      found in the senile plaques in the AD brains. These findings suggest that the 
      increased accumulations of these small heat shock proteins appear to be part of 
      reactive processes of glial cells and neurons under pathologic conditions.

TI  - Emerging roles for cholesterol in Huntington's disease.
PG  - 474-86
LID - 10.1016/j.tins.2011.06.005 [doi]
AB  - Recent findings suggest that alterations in cholesterol homeostasis might be 
      associated with Huntington's disease (HD). Although alterations in cholesterol 
      content have been detected in cell models and several rodent models of HD, it is 
      currently unclear what the potential mechanisms underlying cholesterol perturbations 
      are. Furthermore, it remains to be determined whether these observed changes in 
      cholesterol homeostasis are involved in the pathogenesis of HD or occur as a 
      secondary event. In this review, we provide an overview of current studies that have 
      begun to address these issues and discuss recent findings suggesting that normal 
      huntingtin protein might participate in regulating cholesterol biosynthesis. A 
      better understanding of how alterations in cholesterol levels contribute to the 
      pathophysiology of HD is likely to have significant therapeutic implications for the 
      treatment of this debilitating neurodegenerative disorder.

TI  - Specificity and potential mechanism of sulfatide deficiency in Alzheimer's disease: 
      an electrospray ionization mass spectrometric study.
PG  - 809-18
AB  - Recently, we have demonstrated that sulfatide content was substantially depleted in 
      post-mortem brain samples from subjects with very mild Alzheimer's disease (AD) 
      relative to age-matched controls. However, it is unknown if the observed sulfatide 
      deficiency is AD-specific and what mechanism(s) lead to this depletion. By 
      exploiting the advantages of electrospray ionization mass spectrometry techniques, 
      we examined the specificity and a potential mechanism of sulfatide deficiency in AD 
      in the study. In contrast to the sulfatide depletion observed in AD, it was found 
      that the sulfatide content in post-mortem brain samples from subjects with 
      Parkinson's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies was either higher than or 
      comparable to that observed from controls, respectively, suggesting that sulfatide 
      deficiency is likely specific to AD. Examination of lipid alterations in cultured 
      embryonic rat brain oligodendrocytes treated with amyloid-beta peptide demonstrated 
      that there was no alteration in sulfatide content up to a 24-hr interval after 
      amyloid-beta addition/treatment. However, there were significant decreases in 
      plasmenylethanolamine and increases in sphingomyelin content in the same study. 
      These findings suggest that sulfatide deficiency in AD is unlikely mediated directly 
      by amyloid-beta peptide accumulation. Thus, these results illustrate the specificity 
      of sulfatide deficiency in AD and exclude amyloid-beta accumulation as a factor 
      directly contributing to sulfatide deficiency in AD.

TI  - Correlates of p53- and Fas (CD95)-mediated apoptosis in Alzheimer's disease.
PG  - 73-83
AB  - Apoptosis may be an important mechanism of cell loss in Alzheimer's disease (AD). 
      Experimentally, apoptosis is preceded by nuclear accumulation of p53, and increased 
      expression of Fas (CD95) antigen. In the present study, quantitative Western blot 
      analysis of postmortem frontal and temporal lobe tissue demonstrated significantly 
      higher mean levels of p53 and Fas in AD relative to age-matched controls. 
      Immunohistochemical staining and in situ apoptosis assays demonstrated increased p53 
      and Fas expression and DNA fragmentation in overlapping populations of cortical 
      neurons, and cortical and white matter glial cells distributed in regions damaged by 
      neurodegeneration. Double-label immunohistochemical staining studies revealed p53 
      immunoreactivity in: 1) cortical neurons without tau-immunoreactive neurofibrillary 
      tangles; 2) numerous, but not all tau-immunoreactive neuropil neurites and white 
      matter axons; 3) dystrophic fibrils surrounding amyloid-beta-immunoreactive plaques; 
      and 4) glial cells characterized as A2B5+ protoplasmic astrocytes or 
      oligodendrocytes. The prominent distribution of dystrophic p53-immunoreactive 
      processes around amyloid-beta-containing plaques suggests that amyloid deposits are 
      associated with local neuritic degeneration. In addition, the results suggest that 
      many tau-immunoreactive neuritic processes originate from degenerating (p53) as well 
      as regenerating neurons. Finally, apoptosis of glial cells (A2B5+) required to 
      maintain the functional integrity of axons and dendrites may represent an important 
      pathogenic mechanism of axonal loss and synaptic disconnection in AD.

TI  - Cognitive and neurologic findings in subjects with diffuse white matter lucencies on 
      computed tomographic scan (leuko-araiosis).
PG  - 32-5
AB  - As part of a prospective clinicopathologic study, a cohort of 105 "normal" elderly 
      volunteers was investigated with computed tomographic scans, psychometric testing 
      (Extended Scale for Dementia [ESD]) and neurologic examination. Computed tomographic 
      scans were evaluated for the presence or absence of white matter lucencies, termed 
      leuko-araiosis. These are defined as patchy or diffuse areas of decreased 
      attenuation involving only white matter and with no change in adjacent ventricles or 
      sulci. The nine controls with leuko-araiosis had lower scores on the ESD than the 96 
      controls without leuko-araiosis (mean ESD with leuko-araiosis, 227.1 +/- 14; without 
      leuko-araiosis, 237.1 +/- 8), and the difference remains significant even after 
      adjusting for the possible confounding effects of age, sex, education, and infarct 
      detected on computed tomography. Significant differences were also found comparing 
      subjects with leuko-araiosis and those without in respect to abnormal gait, limb 
      power, plantar response, and the rooting and palmomental reflexes. Leuko-araiosis 
      may represent a marker for early dementia. The pathophysiology of this finding 
      remains uncertain. Our results suggest that white matter abnormalities play a role 
      in the development of intellectual impairment in the elderly.

TI  - The neurology of human immunodeficiency virus infection.
PG  - 665-77
AB  - HIV-infected patients are at markedly increased risk for neurological dysfunction, 
      which may occur at any level of the neuraxis (see Table 1). The most common 
      syndromes--AIDS dementia complex, vacuolar myelopathy, and possibly distal symmetric 
      peripheral neuropathy--appear to be related to HIV infection within the nervous 
      system, rather than due to the immunoincompetence caused by HIV. However, the 
      mechanism(s) by which HIV causes these syndromes, e.g., infecting neurons or 
      oligodendroglia directly, interfering with neurotrophic factors, effecting toxic 
      monokine production, etc., is unknown. Early, albeit incomplete, success with 
      azidothymidine is encouraging. Less commonly, neurological syndromes may be 
      secondary to the immunoincompetence produced by HIV. Many different etiologies--most 
      of which are treatable--have been encountered, but a few of these (cerebral 
      toxoplasmosis, cryptococcal meningitis, primary CNS lymphoma, and progressive 
      multifocal leukoencephalopathy) are responsible for most of the opportunistic 
      complications. Marked differences in symptoms and signs between AIDS patients and 
      immunologically normal patients may complicate recognition of some of these diseases 
      (e.g., herpes simplex encephalitis). Finally, some HIV-associated syndromes, e.g., 
      inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy and retinal microvasculopathy, are 
      of unknown etiology.

TI  - Angiographic abnormalities in progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy: an 
      explanation based on neuropathologic findings.
PG  - 487-94
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) is 
      typically occult at angiography and fails to enhance on MR images. After observing 
      angiographic abnormalities characterized by arteriovenous shunting and pathologic 
      parenchymal blush in patients with AIDS-related PML, often in the absence of 
      contrast enhancement on MR images, we hypothesized that there might be distinct 
      changes in the cerebral microvasculature that account for the reduction in vascular 
      transit time (arteriovenous shunting) in the absence of blood-brain barrier 
      dysfunction. METHODS: The imaging studies and neuropathologic specimens of six 
      patients with biopsy-proved PML were reviewed retrospectively. In all patients 
      contrast-enhanced MR imaging and CT, followed by cerebral angiography, were 
      performed before stereotactically directed biopsy. The angiograms were evaluated for 
      the presence of vascular displacement, pathologic parenchymal blush, arteriovenous 
      shunting, and neovascularity. The CT and MR studies were reviewed for the presence 
      of enhancement of the PML lesions. Biopsy specimens were examined for the presence 
      of necrosis, perivascular inflammation, and neovascularity. RESULTS: All patients 
      had oligodendrocytic intranuclear inclusions diagnostic of PML, together with 
      perivascular inflammation and neovascularity to a varying extent; no other 
      neuropathologic processes were identified. Angiographic abnormalities, characterized 
      by a pathologic parenchymal blush and arteriovenous shunting, were identified in 
      four of the six patients. In only one of these cases, however, was abnormal 
      enhancement identified on cross-sectional imaging studies (MR and CT), and this 
      patient had florid perivascular inflammatory infiltrates histologically. CONCLUSION: 
      The pathologic parenchymal blush and arteriovenous shunting seen angiographically in 
      some patients with PML reflect small-vessel proliferation and perivascular 
      inflammatory changes incited by the presence of the JC virus in infected 
      oligodendrocytes.

TI  - Diffusion abnormality in posterior cingulate fiber tracts in Alzheimer's disease: 
      tract-specific analysis.
PG  - 466-73
LID - 10.1007/s11604-008-0258-3 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to determine diffusion abnormalities in the 
      posterior cingulate fiber tracts (PCFTs) in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) 
      by diffusion tensor tractography (DTT). MATERIALS AND METHODS: We studied 23 AD 
      patients and 18 age-matched normal controls who underwent magnetic resonance imaging 
      using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). DTT of PCFTs was generated from DTI. Mean 
      diffusivity (MD) and fractional anisotropy (FA) were measured in co-registered 
      voxels along with DTT of PCFTs. Student's t-test was used to compare results between 
      the AD patients and normal controls. RESULTS: The MD in PCFTs was significantly 
      higher in AD patients than in normal controls (P = 0.019). The FA in PCFTs was 
      significantly lower in AD patients than in normal controls (P = 0.007). CONCLUSION: 
      The abnormal MD increase and FA decrease, which is considered to indicate a net loss 
      of barriers that restrict water molecular motion and tissue anisotropy of white 
      matter, is consistent with neuropathological data that demonstrate partial loss of 
      myelin, axons, and oligodendrial cells in white matter of AD brains. Our results 
      suggest that MD and FA reflect progression of AD-related histopathological changes 
      in the PCFTs and may represent a useful biological index for monitoring AD.

TI  - Association between blood pressure, white matter lesions, and atrophy of the medial 
      temporal lobe.
PG  - 263-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Blood pressure level is associated with the risk of clinical Alzheimer 
      disease (AD), yet the underlying mechanisms are unclear. High blood pressure levels 
      may cause cerebral small-vessel pathology, which contributes to cognitive decline in 
      patients with AD. Alternatively, in persons with high blood pressure, increased 
      numbers of neurofibrillary tangles and amyloid plaques at autopsy have also been 
      observed, suggesting direct links between blood pressure and AD. OBJECTIVE: To 
      investigate the association of blood pressure and markers of small-vessel disease 
      (white matter lesions [WMLs] on MRI) with hippocampal and amygdalar atrophy on 
      MRI-potential in vivo indicators of Alzheimer pathology. METHODS: In 1995 to 1996, 
      511 nondemented elderly subjects (age 60 to 90) underwent MRI. The extent of WMLs 
      was assessed, and volumes of the hippocampus and amygdala were measured. Blood 
      pressure levels were assessed at the time of MRI and 5 years before the MRI. 
      RESULTS: Higher diastolic blood pressure 5 years before MRI predicted more 
      hippocampal atrophy in persons untreated for hypertension (per SD increase -0.10 mL 
      [95% CI -0.19 to -0.02, p = 0.02]). Conversely, in persons treated for hypertension, 
      a low diastolic blood pressure was associated with more severe atrophy. Persons with 
      more WMLs on MRI more often had severe atrophy of the hippocampus and amygdala. 
      CONCLUSION: Blood pressure and indicators of small-vessel disease in the brain may 
      be associated with atrophy of structures affected by Alzheimer pathology.

TI  - Mini-infarct encephalopathy associated with uncommon microvessel convolute formation 
      presenting with presenile dementia.
PG  - 101-9
AB  - A female patient started to suffer from transient ischemic attacks when she was 47 
      years of age, followed by increasing predominantly left-side spastic tetraparesis, 
      generalized seizures and progressive dementia over a period of 11 years. She died 
      when she was 58 years of age. On gross examination the brain showed enlarged 
      ventricles and arteriosclerotic changes of large extracerebral vessels of the 
      circulus arteriosus. Microscopic examination of the atrophic brain showed 
      innumerable incomplete microinfarcts in the white and gray matter throughout all 
      parts of the brain. In the white matter these lesions were characterized by small 
      foci of demyelination and loss of oligodendrocytes while occasionally some scavenger 
      cells were seen. Axons seemed to be unaffected or displayed irregular axonal 
      regeneratory growth. Any inflammatory reaction failed. In the cerebral cortex and 
      subcortical nuclei the lesions showed loss of neurons and decrease in synaptophysin 
      expression. Intracerebral arteries showed fibrosis or fibrohyalinosis of the entire 
      intracerebral small-vessel network. In addition, numerous uncommon clusters of 
      angioma-like telangiectatic vessels were observed. Medium-sized ischemic infarcts 
      were found in the right putamen and adjacent internal capsule region, left-side 
      dorsolateral brain stem and cerebellar hemisphere as well as a left-side pyramidal 
      tract degeneration. Contralateral pseudohypertrophy of the inferior olivary nucleus 
      was seen. The clinical and the neuropathologic observations made in this patient are 
      compatible with small vessel disease characterized by a multicentric special and not 
      yet described type of incomplete mini-infarcts in cerebral cortex and white matter 
      accompanied by some larger ischemic infarcts of the common type in brain stem and 
      cerebellum.

TI  - Late-onset frontotemporal dementia with a novel exon 1 (Arg5His) tau gene mutation.
PG  - 525-30
AB  - We report a case of frontotemporal dementia and parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17 
      of 5 years' duration in an 81-year-old man whose brother had died at age 86 years 
      with dementia. In this patient, we found frontal and temporal neuronal loss, 
      glial-predominant tau deposits, progressive supranuclear palsy-like straight 
      tubules, accumulation of 4-repeat-predominant Sarkosyl-insoluble tau, and a novel 
      exon 1 (Arg5His) tau gene mutation. This mutation decreased microtubule-promoting 
      capacity and increased fibrillation of tau in vitro. Thus, we consider that the 
      Arg5His mutation is an authentic tau gene abnormality responsible for the patient's 
      tau pathology and late-onset dementia.

AB  - The anatomical progression of neurofibrillary tangle pathology throughout 
      Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis runs inverse to the pattern of developmental 
      myelination, with the disease preferentially affecting thinly myelinated regions. 
      Myelin is comprised 80% of lipids, and the prototypical myelin lipids, 
      galactosylceramide, and sulfatide are critical for neurological function. We 
      observed severe depletion of galactosylceramide and sulfatide in AD brain tissue, 
      which can be traced metabolically to the loss of their biosynthetic precursor, very 
      long chain ceramide. The synthesis of very long chain ceramides is catalyzed by 
      ceramide synthase 2 (CERS2). We demonstrate a significant reduction in CERS2 
      activity as early as Braak stage I/II in temporal cortex, and Braak stage III/IV in 
      hippocampus and frontal cortex, indicating that loss of myelin-specific ceramide 
      synthase activity precedes neurofibrillary tangle pathology in cortical regions. 
      These findings open a new vista on AD pathogenesis by demonstrating a defect in 
      myelin lipid biosynthesis at the preclinical stages of the disease. We posit that, 
      over time, this defect contributes significantly to myelin deterioration, synaptic 
      dysfunction, and neurological decline.

TI  - [Strategies of myelin regeneration with optogenetically controlled glial cells].
PG  - 1357-9
AB  - Microglia, macrophage-like cells in the CNS, are multi-functional cells; they play 
      an important role in removal of dead cells or their remnants by phagocytosis in the 
      CNS degeneration as well as are one of important cells in the CNS cytokine network. 
      They are thought to be originated from mesoderm, and to be similar cells to other 
      tissue-resident macrophages. As macrophages, activated microglia have been shown to 
      remove potentially deleterious debris and promote tissue repair by secreting 
      neurotrophic factors at the neuronal injury sites, however, they can release 
      potentially cytotoxic substances in vitro, and at least so-called fully activated 
      form of microglia which are observed at the injury site in AIDS dementia is 
      neurotoxic. These suggest that some factor(s) may contribute to change microglial 
      phenotype from protective to toxic, but the detail is not clear. Recently we 
      generated channelrhodopsin-mutant protein expressing microglia, Ra2_GR and 6-3_GR. 
      Channelrhodopsin is an ion channel activated by light irradiation. Intracellular 
      sodium ion increased by light irradiation in both Ra2_GR and 6-3_GR accompanied by 
      increase of mRNA expression such as pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines and iNOS. 
      This technique can control microglial activation, therefore, it may provide a new 
      strategy for repair/regeneration of neural and oligodendrocytic damages.

TI  - Cognitive and neurologic findings in demented patients with diffuse white matter 
      lucencies on computed tomographic scan (leuko-araiosis).
PG  - 36-9
AB  - A series of patients referred to the University of Western Ontario, London, Dementia 
      Study for investigation of possible dementia underwent computed tomographic scans, 
      psychometric testing (Extended Scale for Dementia [ESD]), and neurologic 
      examination. Thirty-nine of the 113 patients studied (ischemic score, less than or 
      equal to 4) were found to have leuko-araiosis, which we have defined as patchy or 
      diffuse lucencies in the white matter. Patients with leuko-araiosis had 
      significantly lower mean scores on the ESD, 109.7 +/- 61.2, compared with mean 
      scores of 148.5 +/- 78.0 in those without. However, only a trend toward lower scores 
      on the ESD was observed when age, sex, education, and infarct were taken into 
      account in the analysis of covariance. Leuko-araiosis was found to be associated 
      with increasing age, hypertension, abnormalities of power in the limbs, and 
      extensor-plantar responses in this sample of patients. In patients with Alzheimer's 
      disease (AD) alone, diagnosed clinically, 29 out of 91 demonstrated leuko-araiosis 
      on computed tomography, but scores on the ESD in this group overall were not 
      significantly different when those with and without leuko-araiosis were compared. In 
      less advanced cases, however, a highly significant trend was evident for 
      leuko-araiosis to be associated with increased dementia in AD. The results are 
      consistent with the hypothesis that leuko-araiosis is associated with dementia in 
      AD, and that this is either most marked or most easily identifiable before the 
      dementia becomes very severe.

TI  - Distinct isoforms of tau aggregated in neurons and glial cells in brains of patients 
      with Pick's disease, corticobasal degeneration and progressive supranuclear palsy.
PG  - 167-73
AB  - We investigated isoform composition of aggregated tau protein in brains with Pick's 
      disease (PiD), corticobasal degeneration (CBD) and progressive supranuclear palsy 
      (PSP) by immunoblot analysis of sarkosyl-insoluble fractions of brain homogenates. 
      We also examined the adjacent brain tissues immunohistochemically with a rabbit 
      antibody, Ex10, which specifically recognizes exon 10 of tau. The Ex10 recognizes 
      tau isoforms with four microtubule-binding repeats (4Rtau) but not those with three 
      microtubule-binding repeats (3Rtau). Sarkosyl-insoluble tau from the brains of 
      patients with CBD and PSP consisted of 4Rtau. Insoluble tau from the PiD brains 
      contained both 3Rtau and 4Rtau, where 3Rtau predominated over 4Rtau. In brain 
      tissues of CBD and PSP, Ex10 immunostained all neuronal and glial tau-positive 
      structures. They included pre-tangles, astrocytic plaques, tuft-shaped astrocytes, 
      and oligodendroglial coiled bodies. In PiD brains, astrocytic inclusions were also 
      positive for 4Rtau. However, the majority of, if not all, Pick bodies and 
      oligodendroglial tau inclusions were negative for 4Rtau. Such results suggest that, 
      in neurons and oligodendroglia, tau isoforms involved in the pathological processes 
      differ between CBD/PSP and PiD, and are thus disease specific. This contrasts with 
      the astrocytic tau isoforms that accumulate similarly in all three disorders.

TI  - Morphological spectrum, distribution and clinical correlation of white matter 
      lesions in AIDS brains.
PG  - 489-501
AB  - This paper analyses the histopathological characteristics and the topographical 
      distribution of 'pure' HIV-associated white matter lesions of the brain in 18 AIDS 
      patients at autopsy; it includes a time-controlled correlation of neuropathology to 
      clinical staging of the AIDS dementia complex. Three distinct lesion types can be 
      delineated: 1 Vacuolar myelin damage (n = 15) in the hemispheric and 
      interhemispheric white matter, in projection fibre tracts, and in intracerebral 
      segments of cranial nerves III, VII, and VIII; 2 Angiocentric foci (n = 14), 
      disseminated randomly in the white matter; 3 HIV leukoencephalopathy (n = 14), as 
      previously defined, seen predominantly in the hemispheric white matter. As a sole 
      lesion type, HIV leukoencephalopathy is found in two cases, while vacuolar myelin 
      damage and angiocentric foci always occur in combination with one or both other 
      types of pathology. Patients with advanced AIDS-dementia complex consistently show 
      severe and combined white matter pathologies at autopsy. We conclude that, in 
      addition to the previously defined features of diffuse HIV leukoencephalopathy, 
      vacuolar myelin damage and angiocentric foci are significant and frequent components 
      of white matter pathology in AIDS autopsies. This reflects the multitude of 
      pathogenetic factors which co-operate in damaging the brain in AIDS. The advanced 
      AIDS dementia complex correlates with the combined and severe white matter lesions.

TI  - Decreasing myelin density reflected increasing white matter pathology in Alzheimer's 
      disease--a neuropathological study.
PG  - 919-26
AB  - BACKGROUND: White matter disease (WMD) is frequently seen in Alzheimer's disease 
      (AD) at neuropathological examination. It is defined as a subtotal tissue loss with 
      a reduction of myelin, axons and oligodendrocytes as well as astrocytosis. Studies 
      quantitatively defining the myelin loss in AD are scarce. The aim was to develop a 
      method that could provide numerical values of myelin density in AD. The purpose was 
      to compare the myelin contents in increasing grades of pathology of WMD, with age 
      and cortical AD pathology as well as in different regions of the brain in AD. 
      MATERIAL AND METHODS: Sixteen cases with AD and concomitant WMD were investigated 
      with an in-house developed image analysis technique to determine the myelin 
      attenuation with optical density (OD) in frontoparietal, parietal, temporal and 
      occipital white matter on whole brain coronal sections stained for myelin with Luxol 
      Fast Blue (LFB). The OD values in LFB were compared grouped according to 
      Haematoxylin/Eosin (HE) evaluated mild, moderate and severe WMD or normal tissue. 
      The OD values were also correlated with age and cortical AD pathology and compared 
      between the different studied white matter regions. RESULTS: Increasing severity of 
      WMD was associated with a statistically significant OD reduction. No correlation was 
      seen between age and OD or overall cortical AD pathology. The OD values were 
      significantly lower in frontoparietal-compared to occipital white matter. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Myelin loss in AD with WMD is a marked morphologic component of the 
      disease and it is possible to determine the reduction objectively in 
      neuropathological specimens with quantitative measures. This may be of use for 
      clinical diagnostics including brain imaging.

TI  - Neuroimaging correlates of subjective memory deficits in a community population.
PG  - 1601-7
LID - 10.1212/01.wnl.0000310982.99438.54 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Subjective memory deficit (SMD) is one of few potential presenting 
      symptoms for people with early cognitive impairment. However, associations with 
      underlying brain changes are unclear. METHODS: In a community sample of 1,779 people 
      without dementia, and with neuroimaging (MRI) data, associations were investigated 
      for SMD with white matter lesion volume and with the following volumetric measures: 
      gray and white matter, CSF, hippocampal, parahippocampal, and amygdalar. Covariates 
      included depressive symptoms (Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale), a 
      battery of cognitive tests, physical health, and social activity. RESULTS: SMD was 
      present in 26.4% of the sample. Of the neuroimaging measures analyzed, SMD was most 
      strongly associated with temporal WML (OR for highest quintile compared to the 
      remainder 1.44, 95% CI 1.12-1.85), and lower hippocampal volume (OR per decreasing 
      quintile 1.22, 1.11-1.35). These associations were independent of all other 
      covariates, including cognitive function. CONCLUSIONS: Subjective memory deficit 
      (SMD) was associated with neuroimaging characteristics in the temporal and 
      hippocampal regions, suggesting that SMD may, at least in some cases, represent a 
      realistic appraisal of underlying brain function independent of measured cognition. 
      However, further research is required for volumetric measures and SMD to establish 
      whether the association reflects lifelong structure or neurodegenerative changes.

TI  - Collapsin response mediator protein-2 phosphorylation promotes the reversible 
      retraction of oligodendrocyte processes in response to non-lethal oxidative stress.
PG  - 985-95
LID - 10.1111/j.1471-4159.2012.07742.x [doi]
AB  - The extension of processes of oligodendrocyte (OLG) and their precursor cells are 
      crucial for migration, axonal contact and myelination. Here we show that a 
      non-lethal oxidative stress induced by 3-nitropropionic acid (3-NP) elicited a rapid 
      shortening of processes (~24%) in primary OLGs and in oligodendroglial cell line 
      (OLN-93) cells (~36%) as compared with vehicle-exposed cells. This was reversible 
      and prevented by antioxidants. Proteomics of OLG lysates with and without 3-NP 
      treatment yielded collapsin response mediator protein 2 (CRMP-2) as a candidate 
      effector molecule. Inhibition of rho kinase was sufficient to prevent process 
      retraction in both OLGs and OLN-93 cells. Oxidative stress increased phosphorylation 
      of CRMP-2 at T555 that was completely prevented by Y27632. Moreover, transfection of 
      OLN-93 cells with the mutant CRMP-2 T555A which cannot be phosphorylated by rho 
      kinase, prevented process shortening induced by 3-NP as compared with wild-type 
      CRMP-2. Our results suggest a role for endogenous reactive oxygen species in a 
      pathway that regulates OLG process extension. The vulnerability of late myelinated 
      neurons in the adult brain and the presence of white matter pathology in human 
      dementias warrant the study of this oligodendroglial pathway in the early stages of 
      neurodegenerative conditions characterized by oxidative stress.

TI  - Accumulation of NACP/alpha-synuclein in lewy body disease and multiple system 
      atrophy.
PG  - 605-8
AB  - OBJECTIVES: NACP/alpha-synuclein is an aetiological gene product in familial 
      Parkinson's disease. To clarify the pathological role of NACP/alpha-synuclein in 
      sporadic Parkinson's disease and other related disorders including diffuse Lewy body 
      disease (DLBD) and multiple system atrophy (MSA), paraffin sections were examined 
      immunocytochemically using anti-NACP/alpha-synuclein antibodies. METHODS: A total of 
      58 necropsied brains, from seven patients with Parkinson's disease, five with DLBD, 
      six with MSA, 12 with Alzheimer's disease, one with Down's syndrome, one with 
      amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), three with ALS and dementia, one with 
      Huntington's disease, two with progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), one with Pick's 
      disease, one with myotonic dystrophy, and three with late cerebellar cortical 
      atrophy (LCCA), and 15 elderly normal controls were examined. RESULTS: In addition 
      to immunoreactive Lewy bodies, widespread accumulation of NACP/alpha-synuclein was 
      found in neurons and astrocytes from the brainstem and basal ganglia to the cerebral 
      cortices in Parkinson's disease/DLBD. NACP/alpha-synuclein accumulates in 
      oligodendrocytes from the spinal cord, the brain stem to the cerebellar white 
      matter, and inferior olivary neurons in MSA. These widespread accumulations were not 
      seen in other types of dementia or spinocerebellar ataxia. CONCLUSION: Completely 
      different types of NACP/alpha-synuclein accumulation in Parkinson's disease/DLBD and 
      MSA suggest that accumulation is a major step in the pathological cascade of both 
      diseases and provides novel strategies for the development of therapies.

TI  - Observations on the clinical presentations and the neuropathological findings of 
      amyotrophic lateral sclerosis in Australia and Guam.
PG  - 62-6
AB  - Among 20 consecutive autopsies of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) occurring in 
      Caucasians in Western Australia (WA), 85% were males. The median age of onset was 
      58.9 years and the average duration of illness was 2.4 years. Twenty-two randomly 
      selected ALS occurring among natives in Guam also showed a male predominance of 75%, 
      younger age of onset (median 48.5 years) and longer survival period (median 3.4 
      years). 45% of the WA patients presented with bulbar involvement at the time of 
      first examination. These patients had the lowest median survival period of 1.5 years 
      when compared with the other forms of ALS, the classic upper and lower motor system 
      involvement and progressive muscular atrophy. Theneuropathologic lesions of ALS in 
      WA and Guam were similar with the exception that neurofibrillary tangles were 
      frequently present in the Guamanian brains. In 14%, neuronal loss, gliosis and 
      frequency of tangles in the cerebral cortex especially in Ammon's horn, substantia 
      nigra, and locus ceruleus, were sufficiently severe to indicate the coexistence of 
      another disorder, Parkinsonism-Dementia Complex. This condition was not clinically 
      recognized. In the WA cases only one patient had tangles in the brain and he had 
      concurrent Alzheimers disease. While senile plaques were present in this patient 
      they were usually absent in the Guamanian brains.

TI  - Developmental regulation of TREM2 and DAP12 expression in the murine CNS: 
      implications for Nasu-Hakola disease.
PG  - 38-45
LID - 10.1007/s11064-008-9657-1 [doi]
AB  - Trem2 is an orphan, DAP12 associated receptor constitutively expressed in vivo by 
      subsets of microglia in the healthy adult murine CNS and in vitro by subsets of 
      oligodendrocytes in neonatal mixed glial cultures. Loss of a functional Trem2 
      signaling pathway is the genetic cause of Nasu-Hakola disease. Whether the early 
      onset cognitive dementia and myelin-pallor associated with this disorder are due to 
      deficits in functional Trem2 signaling in microglia and/or oligodendrocytes is still 
      being debated. Here, we find that Trem2/DAP12 expression is detected in embryonic 
      day 14 CNS mRNA. Using dual immunohistochemistry/in situ hybridization, we find that 
      both Trem2 and DAP12 expression always co-localized with markers of 
      microglia/macrophages. However, Trem2/DAP12 positive microglia are found in very 
      close apposition with CNP+ oligodendrocytes prior to myelination (post-natal day 1). 
      In addition, CNS expression of TREM2 and DAP12 are not detected in PU.1KO which lack 
      microglia and macrophages. Our data provide continuing support for Nasu-Hakola 
      disease being identified as a cognitive disorder caused by a primary dysfunction of 
      CNS microglia.

TI  - Casein kinase 1 delta is associated with pathological accumulation of tau in several 
      neurodegenerative diseases.
PG  - 503-10
AB  - The distribution of casein kinase 1 delta (Cki delta) was studied by 
      immunohistochemistry and correlated with other pathological hallmarks in Alzheimer's 
      disease (AD), Down syndrome (DS), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), parkinsonism 
      dementia complex of Guam (PDC), Pick's disease (PiD), pallido-ponto-nigral 
      degeneration (PPND), Parkinson's disease (PD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), 
      amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and elderly controls. Cki delta was found to be 
      associated generally with granulovacuolar bodies and tau-containing neurofibrillary 
      tangles in AD, DS, PSP, PDC, PPND, and controls, and Pick bodies and ballooned 
      neurons in PiD. It was not associated with tau-containing inclusions in astroglia 
      and oligodendroglia in PPND, PSP, and PDC. It was also not associated with 
      tau-negative Lewy bodies in PD and DLB, Hirano bodies in PDC, Marinesco bodies in 
      PD, AD, and controls and "skein"-like inclusions in anterior motor neurons in ALS. 
      The colocalization of the kinase Cki delta and its apparent substrate tau suggests a 
      function for Cki delta in the abnormal processing of tau.

TI  - Heterogeneous age-related breakdown of white matter structural integrity: 
      implications for cortical "disconnection" in aging and Alzheimer's disease.
PG  - 843-51
AB  - Human and non-human primate data suggest that the structural integrity of myelin 
      sheaths deteriorates during normal aging, especially in the late-myelinating 
      association regions and may result in "disconnection" of widely distributed neural 
      networks. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was used to assess the heterogeneity of 
      this process and its impact on brain aging and Alzheimer's disease (AD) by 
      evaluating early- and later-myelinating regions of the corpus callosum, the splenium 
      (Scc) and genu (Gcc), respectively. Calculated transverse relaxation rates (R2), an 
      indirect measure of white matter structural integrity for the Gcc and Scc, were 
      examined. The relationship between age and R2 differed in the two regions. A 
      quadratic (inverted U) function with an accelerating rate of decline beginning at 
      age 31 best represented the Gcc pattern while the Scc decline was three-fold 
      smaller, gradual, and linear. These data suggest that the severity of age-related 
      myelin breakdown is regionally heterogeneous, consistent with the hypothesis that 
      differences in myelin properties make later-myelinating regions more susceptible to 
      this process. In AD this process is globally exacerbated, consistent with an 
      extracellular deleterious process such as amyloid beta-peptide toxicity. 
      Non-invasive measures such as R2 may be useful in primary prevention studies of AD.

      pathologically defined by extracellular amyloid plaques, intraneuronal 
      neurofibrillary tangles, and synaptic disintegrity. AD has not been widely 
      considered a disease of white matter, but more recent evidence suggests the 
      existence of abnormalities in myelination patterns and myelin attrition in 
      AD-afflicted human brains. Herein, we demonstrate that triple-transgenic AD 
      (3xTg-AD) mice, which harbor the human amyloid precursor protein Swedish mutant 
      transgene, presenilin knock-in mutation, and tau P301L mutant transgene, exhibit 
      significant region-specific alterations in myelination patterns and in 
      oligodendrocyte marker expression profiles at time points preceding the appearance 
      of amyloid and tau pathology. These immunohistochemical signatures are coincident 
      with age-related alterations in axonal and myelin sheath ultrastructure as 
      visualized by comparative electron microscopic examination of 3xTg-AD and 
      nontransgenic mouse brain tissue. Overall, these findings indicate that 3xTg-AD mice 
      represent a viable model in which to examine mechanisms underlying AD-related 
      myelination and neural transmission defects that occur early during presymptomatic 
      stages of the disease process.

PG  - 428-38
AB  - The human polyomavirus JCV lytically infects oligodendrocytes of immunosuppressed 
      individuals leading to the fatal demyelinating disease termed progressive multifocal 
      leukoencephalopathy (PML). Dementia, hemiparesis, and hemianopsia are the 
      predominant presenting signs of PML. Asymptomatic JCV infection is common worldwide 
      with approximately 80% of adults testing positive for JCV antibodies. In addition to 
      the brain, JCV has been shown to infect tonsil, lymphoid, bone marrow, and kidney 
      tissues. Viral variants, classified according to the nucleotide sequences of their 
      regulatory regions, are being mapped in human tissues and cell types to help trace 
      the pathway of JCV from a site of initial infection to target oligodendrocytes. In 
      most literature, a dichotomy of the JCV regulatory region structure exists by 
      tissue. B lymphocytes, however, have demonstrated the capacity to harbor JCV of 
      diverse regulatory regions, which helps position their interaction with virus amid 
      every stage of infection and implicates a lymphocytic role in latency.

TI  - Ubiquitin-negative mini-pick-like bodies in the dentate gyrus in p301l tauopathy.
PG  - 445-54
AB  - Neuropathological and biochemical findings are reported in a patient who had 
      suffered from frontotemporal dementia associated with a P310L mutation in the tau 
      gene and included in the H1 haplotype. Tau accumulation, as revealed with 
      phospho-specific anti-tau antibodies Thr181, Ser199, Ser202, Ser214, Ser262, Ser396, 
      Ser422 and AT8 (Ser202 and Thr205), was found in neurons with pre-tangles, and 
      astrocytes and oligodendrocytes through the brain. The most characteristic feature 
      was tau immunoreactivity decorating the perinuclear region and small cytoplasmic 
      aggregates designed as mini-Pick-like bodies, mainly in the dentate gyrus. 
      Inclusions were not stained with anti-ubiquitin antibodies and did not recruit 
      tubulins. Tau accumulation in individual cells was associated with increased 
      expression of kinases linked with tau phosphorylation, mainly active 
      (phosphorylated) stress kinases SAPK/JNK and p38 (SAPK/JNK-P and p38-P). 
      Phosphorylated GSK-3 beta at Ser9 (GSK-3 beta-P), that inactivates the kinase, was 
      particularly abundant in mini-Pick-like bodies, thus suggesting alternative roles of 
      GSK-3 probably involved in cell survival. Western blots of sarkosyl-insoluble 
      fractions revealed a double band pattern of phospho-tau of 68/66 kDa and 64 kDa in 
      the hippocampus and white matter in the P310L mutation. Sarkosyl-insoluble fractions 
      of the hippocampus were enriched in p38-P and GSK-3 beta-P in Alzheimer's disease 
      (AD) cases, processed in parallel for comparative purposes, but not in the P310L 
      mutation. In addition, no bands of high molecular weight were found in P310L in 
      contrast with AD in these fractions. These findings indicate that the major sites of 
      tau phosphorylation, and the expression of kinases involved in tau phosphorylation 
      are active in P310L mutation as in AD and other tauopathies. Yet the P310L mutation 
      has particular phospho-tau inclusions that are not tag with ubiquitin and appear to 
      be rather soluble when compared with AD.

TI  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) with and without white matter pathology-clinical 
      identification of concurrent cardiovascular disorders.
PG  - 277-86
AB  - Clinical vascular features, either as manifest vascular disease or as cardiovascular 
      risk factors were compared in AD with and without neuropathological white matter 
      disease (WMD). The aim of the study was to investigate whether the presence of WMD 
      and the severity of either AD pathology or WMD were associated with different 
      cardiovascular profiles. A total of 44 AD cases were retrospectively studied. All 
      the cases were neuropathologically diagnosed as AD with WMD (n=22) and as AD without 
      WMD (n=22), respectively. The patients' medical records were studied with regard to 
      their medical history and to somatic and neurological findings including arrhythmia, 
      congestive heart failure, angina, myocardial infarctions, signs of TIA/stroke, 
      diabetes mellitus, and blood pressure abnormalities, such as hypertension and 
      orthostatic hypotension. In AD-WMD, hypertension, orthostatic hypotension as well as 
      dizziness/unsteadiness were significantly more common than in AD without WMD. 
      Cardiovascular symptoms were more frequent in AD-WMD than in the other group, though 
      the difference did not reach statistical significance. Hypothetically, abnormal and 
      unstable blood pressure levels underlie recurrent cerebral hypoperfusion, which may 
      in turn leave room for the development of WMD. Furthermore, dizziness/unsteadiness 
      may be a symptom reflecting the presence of WMD.

TI  - Metallothionein I-II immunocytochemical reactivity in Binswanger's encephalopathy.
PG  - 459-66
AB  - Binswanger's disease is a subacute form of hypertensive encephalopathy characterized 
      by patchy-confluent myelin loss of the deep hemispheric white matter, associated 
      with marked regressive changes of the oligodendrocytes and variable astroglial 
      reaction. To understand the distribution and the specificity of astrocyte pathology 
      in Binswanger's disease we quantified reactive and degenerating astrocytes in 
      different regions of the deep and subcortical white matter and of the cerebral 
      cortex. Sections of frontal, temporal, parietal, and occipital lobes of 12 
      histologically proven cases of Binswanger's disease were immunostained with 
      antibodies to glial fibrillary protein (GFAP) and to metallothionein I and II 
      (MT-I-II), markers which specifically identify normal and reactive astrocytes. 
      Control tissues were from 6 elderly patients without neurological diseases. The 
      brains of Binswanger's disease were characterized by few and lightly immunostained 
      astrocytes in the deep white matter, but normal and reactive astrocytes, strongly 
      immunoreactive for GFAP and MT-I-II, were prominent in the subcortical white matter 
      and the cerebral cortex. However, the relative distribution of GFAP positive and 
      MT-I-II positive astrocytes was significantly different between the cerebral cortex 
      and the subcortical white matter, the MT-I-II positive astrocytes being more 
      frequent in the cerebral cortex, and the GFAP positive astrocytes in the subcortical 
      white matter (p < 0.02). The GFAP and MT-I-II expressions in subsets of reactive 
      astrocytes in the cortico-subcortical layers together with regressive astroglial 
      changes in the deep white matter suggest that the dynamic plasticity of astroglia is 
      topographically and biochemically differentiated in vascular dementia of Binswanger 
      type.

TI  - Progressive supranuclear palsy: neuronal and glial cytoskeletal pathology in the 
      higher order processing autonomic nuclei of the lower brainstem.
PG  - 12-22
AB  - The medial and lateral parabrachial nuclei (MPB, LPB), the gigantocellular reticular 
      nucleus (GI), the raphes magnus (RMG) and raphes obscurus nuclei (ROB), as well as 
      the intermediate reticular zone (IRZ) represent pivotal subordinate brainstem 
      centres, all of which control autonomic functions. In this study, we investigated 
      the occurrence and severity of the neuronal and glial cytoskeletal pathology in 
      these six brainstem nuclei from 17 individuals with clinically diagnosed and 
      neuropathologically confirmed progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP). The association 
      between the severity of the pathology and the duration of the disease was 
      investigated by means of correlation analysis. The brainstem nuclei in all of the 
      PSP cases were affected by the neuronal cytoskeletal pathology, with the IRZ and GI 
      regularly showing severe involvement, the MPB, RMG, and ROB marked involvement, and 
      the LPB mild involvement. In the six nuclear greys studied, glial cells undergo 
      alterations of their cytoskeleton on an irregular basis, whereby diseased 
      oligodendrocytes predominantly presented as coiled bodies and affected astrocytes as 
      thorn-shaped astrocytes. In all six nuclei, the severity of the neuronal or glial 
      cytoskeletal pathology showed no correlation with the duration of PSP. In view of 
      their functional role, the neuronal pathology in the nuclei studied offers a 
      possible explanation for the autonomic dysfunctions that eventually develop in the 
      course of PSP.

PG  - 818-27
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe the clinical features, neuropathology, and genetic studies in 
      a family with autosomal dominant frontotemporal dementia (FTD). BACKGROUND: Clinical 
      Pick's disease, or FTD with parkinsonism, has been described in several families 
      linked to chromosome 17 (FTDP-17). Most of these have shown tau protein mutations. 
      The clinical and pathologic variations in these families resemble the spectrum of 
      sporadic FTD or "Pick complex." METHODS: Clinical and behavioral analysis of the 
      affected members with extensive histochemical and neuropathologic description of 
      three cases, genetic analysis of three clinically affected members and seven at risk 
      members to assess linkage to chromosome 17, and sequencing of the tau gene in two 
      patients were performed. RESULTS: The clinical pattern shows a highly stereotypic 
      disinhibition dementia with late extrapyramidal features, progressive mutism, and 
      terminal dysphagia in three generations of affected individuals. Neuropathology 
      showed frontotemporal atrophy, and microscopically tau- and synuclein-negative and 
      ubiquitin-positive neuronal inclusions, in the background of superficial cortical 
      spongiosis, neuronal loss, and gliosis. Tau expression was restricted to 
      oligodendroglia. All exons and surrounding introns of the tau gene were sequenced, 
      and no mutation or disease-related polymorphisms were detected in either of two 
      affected pedigree members. CONCLUSION: This family with autosomal dominant 
      frontotemporal dementia (FTD) shows no tau expression in neurons. The 
      ubiquitin-positive, tau-negative inclusions have been described before in FTD with 
      and without motor neuron disease, but not in a familial form. The clinical and some 
      pathologic features are similar to those of several of the families included in 
      descriptions of FTD with parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17, but the linkage to 
      tau has been excluded. The defect in this family, however, could be functionally 
      related to tau mutations.

TI  - Gallyas- and tau-positive glial structures in motor neuron disease with dementia.
PG  - 218-25
AB  - We have studied Gallyas- and tau-positive glial structures in three autopsied cases 
      of motor neuron disease with dementia (MND-D). Gallyas-positive, tau-immunoreactive 
      thread-like structures in the neuropil and crescent/coiled inclusions in the glial 
      cells were mainly observed in the hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus, and amygdaloid 
      nucleus. Double staining using Gallyas staining and carbonic anhydrase 2 (CA2) 
      immunohistochemistry revealed that some crescent/coiled inclusions occurred in the 
      CA2-immunopositive cytoplasm of the oligodendroglia. Electron microscopic study with 
      the Gallyas-Braak method revealed that the inclusion was a reticular, partly compact 
      mass, containing 15 nm fibrils around round or oval nuclei. Since the regions where 
      these structures appeared exhibited neuronal loss with gliosis, these data suggest 
      that a cytoskeletal abnormality involving tau protein in glia might be associated 
      with the degenerative process of MND-D.

TI  - Cortical and striatal neurone number in Huntington's disease.
PG  - 320-33
AB  - The total cortical and striatal neurone and glial numbers were estimated in five 
      cases of Huntington's disease (three males, two females) and five age- and 
      sex-matched control cases. Serial 500-microns-thick gallocyanin-stained frontal 
      sections through the left hemisphere were analysed using Cavalieri's principle for 
      volume and the optical disector for cell density estimations. The average cortical 
      neurone number of five controls (mean age 53 +/- 13 years, range 36-72 years) was 
      5.97 x 10(9) +/- 320 x 10(6), the average number of small striatal neurones was 82 x 
      10(6) +/- 15.8 x 10(6). The left striatum (caudatum, putamen, and accumbens) 
      contained a mean of 273 x 10(6) +/- 53 x 10(6) glial cells (oligodendrocytes, 
      astrocytes and unclassifiable glial profiles). The mean cortical neurone number in 
      Huntington's disease patients (mean age 49 +/- 14 years, range 36-75 years) was 
      diminished by about 33% to 3.99 x 10(9) +/- 218 x 10(6) nerve cells (P < or = 0.012, 
      Mann-Whitney U-test). The mean number of small striatal neurones decreased 
      tremendously to 9.72 x 10(6) +/- 3.64 x 10(6) (-88%). The decrease in total glial 
      cells was less pronounced (193 x 10(6) +/- 26 x 10(6)) but the mean glial index, the 
      numerical ratio of glial cells per neurone, increased from 3.35 to 22.59 in 
      Huntington's disease. Qualitatively, neuronal loss was most pronounced in 
      supragranular layers of primary sensory areas (Brodmann's areae 3,1,2; area 17, area 
      41). Layer IIIc pyramidal cells were preferentially lost in association areas of the 
      temporal, frontal, and parietal lobes, whereas spared layer IV granule cells formed 
      a conspicuous band between layer III and V in these fields. Methodological issues 
      are discussed in context with previous investigations and similarities and 
      differences of laminar and lobar nerve cell loss in Huntington's disease are 
      compared with nerve cell degeneration in other neuropsychiatric diseases.

TI  - Atypical progressive supranuclear palsy with corticospinal tract degeneration.
PG  - 396-405
AB  - Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), corticobasal degeneration (CBD), sporadic 
      multisystem tauopathy, and some forms of frontotemporal dementia with Parkinsonism 
      linked to chromosome 17 are characterized by neuronal and glial lesions accumulating 
      tau protein containing 4 conserved repeats in microtubule-binding domain (4R tau). 
      Corticospinal tract degeneration is not a common feature of 4R tauopathies. Our 
      objective was to describe 12 cases with pathologic features similar to those of PSP 
      but with prominent corticospinal tract degeneration. We reviewed the historical 
      records and neuropathologic evaluation using standardized sampling, 
      immunohistochemistry, semiquantitative analysis, image analysis, and electron 
      microscopy. The mean age at onset and illness duration was 71 and 5.7 years, 
      respectively. Eight cases were female. Eleven cases had clinical evidence of 
      prominent upper motor neuron disease plus extrapyramidal features. There was focal 
      parasagittal cortical atrophy involving motor cortex and degeneration of 
      corticospinal tract with sparing of lower motor neurons like in primary lateral 
      sclerosis. Prominent tau pathology was found in oligodendrocytes in motor cortex, 
      subjacent white matter, and corticospinal tract characterized by globular 
      cytoplasmic filamentous inclusions that were immunoreactive for 4R tau. The 
      clinicopathologic features of these 12 cases expand the spectrum of 4R tauopathies.

TI  - A functional role for corpora amylacea based on evidence from complement studies.
PG  - 335-45
AB  - Few theories have been advanced for the production of corpora amylacea (CA) by the 
      normal ageing brain and by the CNS under various neurological conditions. Proteins 
      derived from neurons and oligodendrocytes are found in CA and to understand their 
      origins brain tissue from patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), multiple sclerosis 
      (MS) and Pick's disease (PD) were tested for complement activity. All CA were 
      immunopositive for antisera to classical pathway-specific components, the activation 
      products C3d and the terminal complement complex (TCC), the C3 convertase regulator 
      membrane cofactor protein (MCP) and the fluid phase regulators S-protein and 
      clusterin. CA were immunonegative for the alternative complement pathway proteins 
      and the complement regulators, decay accelerating factor (DAF) and CD59. Western 
      immunoblotting of isolated solubilized CA from the same tissues demonstrated a weak 
      band for MCP but TCC was more easily shown by immunoprecipitation. A filamentous 
      fringe around CA, probably of astrocytic origin, was also immunopositive for 
      complement factors. CA consist of an inert mucopolysaccharide matrix encasing 
      ubiquitinated proteins, resulting from death of and damage to neurons, myelin and 
      oligodendrocytes. A function of CA, therefore, could be to prevent the recognition 
      of these immunogenic proteins by lymphocytes and microglia and thus protect the CNS 
      from further injury.

TI  - Establishment of microglial cell cultures derived from postmortem human adult brain 
      tissue: immunophenotypical and functional characterization.
PG  - 34-9
AB  - Cell cultures have become an integral part of the daily routine in most biological 
      research laboratories. Because they are very dynamic and highly accessible, cell 
      cultures permit direct experimental manipulations where cause-effect relations can 
      be more definitely assayed. We have developed cultures of microglial cells from 
      rapid autopsies (range 3-10 hours) of nondemented elderly patients and Alzheimer's 
      disease patients. Cultures were derived from the subcortical white matter, corpus 
      callosum, and frontal, temporal, and occipital cortex. The adherent microglial cells 
      were immunoreactive for CD68, CD45, CD11c, and major histocompatibility complex 
      (MHC) class II markers, and were not immunoreactive for astrocyte or oligodendrocyte 
      markers. In addition, some functional characteristics of the isolated microglial 
      cells were also studied. Upon stimulation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), microglial 
      cells secreted pro- and antiinflammatory mediators, i.e., interleukin- (IL)-6, 
      prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), and IL-10, indicating the functional capacity of cultured 
      microglia.

TI  - Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy pattern of progressive multifocal 
      leukoencephalopathy in AIDS.
PG  - 520-3
AB  - The objective was to determine whether the use of intermediate echo times (135 ms) 
      in proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) detects a homogenous pattern in 
      progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) in HIV-1 infected people, and to 
      confirm the results of previous studies. Six patients infected with HIV-1, with PML 
      established by biopsy, and six healthy age and sex matched volunteers were evaluated 
      to define their spectroscopic pattern. 1H-MRS spectra performed at 1.5 T were 
      obtained with the STEAM sequence: TE/TM/TR, 20 ms/13.7 ms/2000 ms; 2500 Hz, size 
      2048 points, 256 acquisitions (STEAM-20) and with the PRESS sequence; TE/TR, 135 
      ms/2000 ms; 2500 Hz, size 2048 points, 256 acquisitions (PRESS-135). A single voxel 
      was placed on the lesions and on the parieto-occipital white matter of controls. The 
      peaks of N-acetylaspartate (NAA), choline (Cho), myoinositol (mI), lactate, and 
      lipids were considered, and the results were expressed using creatine as reference. 
      Spectra of PML lesions were characterised by significantly reduced NAA, lactate 
      presence, and by significantly increased Cho and lipids compared with control group 
      values. These results indicate that 1H-MRS detects a homogenous pattern in PML 
      lesions. Recent studies, together with this, suggest that 1H-MRS may help in the 
      diagnostic approach to patients with suspected PML lesions associated with AIDS.

TI  - Increased complement biosynthesis by microglia and complement activation on neurons 
      in Huntington's disease.
PG  - 362-76
AB  - In this study complement activation and biosynthesis have been analysed in the 
      brains of Huntington's disease (HD) (n = 9) and normal (n = 3) individuals. In HD 
      striatum, neurons, myelin and astrocytes were strongly stained with antibodies to 
      C1q, C4, C3, iC3b-neoepitope and C9-neoepitope. In contrast, no staining for 
      complement components was found in the normal striatum. Marked astrogliosis and 
      microgliosis were observed in all HD caudate and the internal capsule samples but 
      not in normal brain. RT-PCR analysis and in-situ hybridisation were carried out to 
      determine whether complement was synthesised locally by activated glial cells. By 
      RT-PCR, we found that complement activators of the classical pathway C1q C chain, 
      C1r, C4, C3, as well as the complement regulators, C1 inhibitor, clusterin, MCP, 
      DAF, CD59, were all expressed constitutively and at much higher level in HD brains 
      compared to normal brain. Complement anaphylatoxin receptor mRNAs (C5a receptor and 
      C3a receptor) were strongly expressed in HD caudate. In general, we found that the 
      level of complement mRNA in normal control brains was from 2 to 5 fold lower 
      compared to HD striatum. Using in-situ hybridisation, we confirmed that C3 mRNA and 
      C9 mRNA were expressed by reactive microglia in HD internal capsule. We propose that 
      complement produced locally by reactive microglia is activated on the membranes of 
      neurons, contributing to neuronal necrosis but also to proinflammatory activities. 
      Complement opsonins (iC3b) and anaphylatoxins (C3a, C5a) may be involved in the 
      recruitment and stimulation of glial cells and phagocytes bearing specific 
      complement receptors.

TI  - Nogo-A expression in the human hippocampus in normal aging and in Alzheimer disease.
PG  - 433-44
AB  - Myelin-associated proteins are involved in the formation and stabilization of myelin 
      sheaths. In addition, they prevent axon regeneration and plasticity in the adult 
      brain. Recent evidence suggests that the expression of certain myelin-associated 
      proteins (e.g. Nogo-A) can be regulated by synaptic activity or by over-expression 
      after neural lesions in brain syndromes such as temporal lobe epilepsy. However, no 
      studies on Alzheimer disease (AD) have been reported in which cell loss and 
      significant synaptic reorganization occurs. In the present study, we analyze in 
      detail the expression of Nogo-A in the hippocampal formation in normal human aging 
      and in AD. Our results indicate that Nogo-A is expressed by oligodendrocytes and 
      neurons in the aged hippocampal formation. In addition, both granule cells and mossy 
      fiber connections are also labeled in the old-aged hippocampi. Interestingly, Nogo-A 
      is over-expressed by hippocampal neurons in AD and is associated with beta-amyloid 
      deposits in senile plaques. Taken together, our results reinforce the hypothesis 
      that Reticulon proteins such as Nogo-A participate in the neuronal responses 
      stemming from hippocampal formation during senescence, and particularly in AD. These 
      findings also indicate that Reticulon proteins could be considered as new putative 
      drug targets in therapies of neurodegenerative disorders.

TI  - Structural covariance of superficial white matter in mild Alzheimer's disease 
      compared to normal aging.
PG  - 721-37
LID - 10.1002/brb3.252 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Interindividual variations in regional structural properties covary 
      across the brain, thus forming networks that change as a result of aging and 
      accompanying neurological conditions. The alterations of superficial white matter 
      (SWM) in Alzheimer's disease (AD) are of special interest, since they follow the 
      AD-specific pattern characterized by the strongest neurodegeneration of the medial 
      temporal lobe and association cortices. METHODS: Here, we present an SWM network 
      analysis in comparison with SWM topography based on the myelin content quantified 
      with magnetization transfer ratio (MTR) for 39 areas in each hemisphere in 15 AD 
      patients and 15 controls. The networks are represented by graphs, in which nodes 
      correspond to the areas, and edges denote statistical associations between them. 
      RESULTS: In both groups, the networks were characterized by asymmetrically 
      distributed edges (predominantly in the left hemisphere). The AD-related differences 
      were also leftward. The edges lost due to AD tended to connect nodes in the temporal 
      lobe to other lobes or nodes within or between the latter lobes. The newly gained 
      edges were mostly confined to the temporal and paralimbic regions, which manifest 
      demyelination of SWM already in mild AD. CONCLUSION: This pattern suggests that the 
      AD pathological process coordinates SWM demyelination in the temporal and paralimbic 
      regions, but not elsewhere. A comparison of the MTR maps with MTR-based networks 
      shows that although, in general, the changes in network architecture in AD 
      recapitulate the topography of (de)myelination, some aspects of structural 
      covariance (including the interhemispheric asymmetry of networks) have no immediate 
      reflection in the myelination pattern.

TI  - Unraveling the neuroimmune mechanisms for the HIV-1-associated cognitive/motor 
      complex.
PG  - 441-8
AB  - Infection of the brain with human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) often leads to 
      the devastating loss of mental faculties. Surprisingly, HIV-1 elicits such brain 
      dysfunction without significantly infecting neurons, astrocytes and oligodendroglia. 
      The target for HIV-1 in the brain is the macrophage, which usually functions as a 
      phagocytic, antigen-presenting and immune-regulatory cell. How can these cells 
      produce such serious cognitive and motor brain impairments? Here, Hans Nottet and 
      Howard Gendelman propose that HIV-1 penetrates the blood-brain barrier inside 
      differentiating macrophages, which become immune activated once inside the brain, 
      and secrete high levels of neurotoxins. Chronic, subclinical disease results by 
      astrocyte regulation of macrophage effector functions. Ultimately, endogenous 
      control mechanisms break down, leading to motor and mental impairments in some 
      affected subjects.

TI  - Differential cell proliferation in the cortex of the APPswePS1dE9 Alzheimer's 
      disease mouse model.
PG  - 615-29
LID - 10.1002/glia.22295 [doi]
AB  - Plaque deposition in Alzheimer's disease (AD) is known to decrease proliferation in 
      neurogenic niches in AD mouse models, but the effects on cell proliferation and 
      differentiation in other brain areas have not been studied in detail. We analyzed 
      cell proliferation in the cortex of wild type (WT) and APPswePS1dE9 transgenic (AD) 
      mice at different ages. Mice were studied shortly after the last BrdU injection 
      (BrdU[ST]). In AD mice, the number of proliferating cells increased fourfold, 
      coinciding with plaque appearance and its associated reactive gliosis and activation 
      of microglia. An increase in the number of BrdU[ST]-cells expressing markers for 
      activated microglia is underlying the enhanced proliferation. Cortical reactive 
      astrocytes did not become proliferative since BrdU[ST]-cells were negative for 
      different astrocyte-specific markers. The number of Olig2-positive oligodendrocyte 
      precursor cells was unchanged. Four weeks after the last BrdU application, the 
      number of BrdU[LT]-cells with an activated microglia signature was still enhanced in 
      AD mice. None of the newborn cells had differentiated into oligodendrocytes, 
      astrocytes, or neurons. On the basis of these observations, we conclude that amyloid 
      plaque deposition increases proliferation of microglia around plaques but does not 
      affect the proliferation of cortical oligodendrocyte precursor cells. No evidence 
      was found for damage-induced proliferation of reactive astrocytes or for a 
      redirected neurogenesis from the subventricular zone. The proliferation of microglia 
      contributes to the rapid accumulation of microglia around plaques and may play a 
      role in limitating plaque expansion.

TI  - Oligodendrocytes within astrocytes ("emperipolesis") in the white matter in 
      Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.
PG  - 201-6
AB  - The occurrence of oligodendrocytes within astrocytes ("emperipolesis") has been 
      described in demyelinating lesions in cases of multiple sclerosis and also in other 
      non-demyelinating disorders. We found that this finding was common in the cerebral 
      white matter of patients with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD). Eight consecutive 
      autopsy cases of sporadic CJD were reviewed, and in every case the gray matter 
      exhibited classical histopathological features of CJD. In five cases with a long 
      clinical course, the cerebral white matter was severely involved, and both axons and 
      myelin sheaths were lost markedly. Within this devastated white matter, many 
      hypertrophic astrocytes were found to engulf one to several oligodendrocytes within 
      their cytoplasm (emperipolesis). The oligodendroglial nature of the engulfed cells 
      was corroborated by nuclear immunoreactivity for anti-human Olig 2 antibody. In the 
      remaining three cases, whose clinical course was short, the cerebral white matter 
      was relatively well preserved, and emperipolesis was not or only very rarely found. 
      The prevalence of emperipolesis of this type in the white matter in CJD was well 
      correlated with the severity of the white matter lesions.

TI  - HIV-1 infection of cultured human adult oligodendrocytes.
PG  - 211-9
AB  - The mechanism through which HIV-1 causes HIV dementia (HIVD) is not well understood. 
      Myelin pallor is a common pathological finding in HIVD and could be explained by a 
      direct infection of oligodendrocytes or interaction with HIV-1 gp 120. To determine 
      if oligodendrocytes could be infected by HIV-1, we purified oligodendrocytes from 
      adult human brain tissues obtained from temporal lobe resections. These cells were 
      exposed to HIV-1 and infectivity was assayed by detection of p24gag antigen, PCR 
      amplification, and cocultivation with CD4+ cells. These results indicate that 
      HIV-1(IIIB and BaL) and one of four primary isolates tested can infect 
      oligodendrocytes, resulting in the production of infectious virus. Furthermore, in 
      an experiment that mimics a potential in vivo scenario, infected microglia were able 
      to transmit virus to oligodendrocytes in a trans-well culture system. These 
      experiments indicate that oligodendrocyte infection should be considered in studying 
      the pathophysiology of HIVD.

TI  - Discrete impulses in ephaptically coupled nerve fibers.
PG  - 043118
LID - 10.1063/1.4919077 [doi]
AB  - We exclusively analyze the condition for modulated waves to emerge in two 
      ephaptically coupled nerve fibers. Through the multiple scale expansion, it is shown 
      that a set of coupled cable-like Hodgkin-Huxley equations can be reduced to a single 
      differential-difference nonlinear equation. The standard approach of linear 
      stability analysis of a plane wave is used to predict regions of parameters where 
      nonlinear structures can be observed. Instability features are shown to be 
      importantly controlled not only by the ephaptic coupling parameter, but also by the 
      discreteness parameter. Numerical simulations, to verify our analytical predictions, 
      are performed, and we explore the longtime dynamics of slightly perturbed plane 
      waves in the coupled nerve fibers. On initially exciting only one fiber, 
      quasi-perfect interneuronal communication is discussed along with the possibility of 
      recruiting damaged or non-myelinated nerve fibers, by myelinated ones, into 
      conduction.

TI  - Productive HIV-2 infection in the brain is restricted to macrophages/microglia.
PG  - 1451-5
AB  - OBJECTIVES: HIV-2 can use a broader range of co-receptors than HIV-1 in vitro, and 
      is less dependent on CD4 for infection. The aim of this study was to detect 
      productive HIV-2 infection in the brain and investigate whether HIV-2 has an 
      expanded tropism for brain cells in vivo, in comparison with HIV-1, which 
      productively infects macrophages/microglia. DESIGN: Brain samples taken at autopsy 
      from eight patients who died from AIDS, six HIV-2 and two HIV-1/HIV-2 dually 
      seropositive, with HIV encephalitis (HIVE), collected in Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire in 
      1991, were examined for the presence and localization of productive HIV-2 infection. 
      METHODS: Using immunohistochemistry, the presence of HIV-2 p26 in formalin-fixed, 
      wax-embedded brain tissue sections was investigated. Double-staining with glial 
      fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), CD45- and CD68-specific antibodies was performed 
      to identify infected cell types. RESULTS: HIV-2 p26 was detected in brain tissue 
      from four of the HIV-2 cases and one of the dually infected individuals. The 
      productively infected cells were either microglia or infiltrating macrophages. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The productively infected cells in the brains of HIV-2 infected 
      individuals are macrophages/microglia. No evidence was found for productive 
      infection of astrocytes, neurons or oligodendrocytes. Thus, the broader in vitro 
      cell tropism, promiscuous coreceptor usage and relative independence of CD4 by HIV-2 
      compared to HIV-1 does not broaden its range of target cells in the brain.

TI  - Significance of the variant and full-length forms of the very low density 
      lipoprotein receptor in brain.
PG  - 209-15
AB  - The very low density lipoprotein receptor (VLDLR) is a newly described receptor 
      which binds to apolipoprotein E (apoE) specifically. The authors designed a 
      synthetic peptide of 17 amino acids representing the N-terminus of the putative 
      first ligand binding domain of human VLDLR, this being a unique domain for VLDLR. 
      When the synthetic peptide was used as the antigen, two different monoclonal 
      antibodies were obtained (anti-VLDLR1 and anti-VLDLR2). Expressional cloning 
      revealed that anti-VLDLR1 recognized the variant form of VLDLR which lacks 84 bp of 
      O-linked sugar domain and anti-VLDLR2 recognized the full length form of VLDLR. The 
      variant VLDLR was expressed in neuroblasts as well as matrix cells and Cajal-Retzius 
      cells in the early stages of the developing human brain; later its expression was 
      sequentially found in glioblasts, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes and finally in 
      myelin. The expression of a full length form of VLDLR was detected in senile plaques 
      and some neurons and satellite glia in aged and Alzheimer brains. This suggests that 
      the variant VLDLR is important for the developing human brain and the full length 
      VLDLR has modified functions in aged and Alzheimer brains.

AB  - Immunization with an altered myelin-derived peptide (MOG45D) improves recovery from 
      acute CNS insults, partially via recruitment of monocyte-derived macrophages that 
      locally display a regulatory activity. Here, we investigated the local alterations 
      in the cellular and molecular immunological milieu associated with attenuation of 
      Alzheimer's disease-like pathology following immunotherapy. We found that 
      immunization of amyloid precursor protein/presenilin 1 double-transgenic mice with 
      MOG45D peptide, loaded on dendritic cells, led to a substantial reduction of 
      parenchymal and perivascular amyloid beta (Abeta)-plaque burden and soluble 
      Abeta((1-42)) peptide levels as well as reduced astrogliosis and levels of a key 
      glial scar protein (chondroitin sulphate proteoglycan). These changes were 
      associated with a shift in the local innate immune response, manifested by increased 
      Iba1+/CD45(high) macrophages that engulfed Abeta, reduced pro-inflammatory (tumor 
      necrosis factor-alpha) and increased anti-inflammatory (interleukin-10) cytokines, 
      as well as a significant increase in growth factors (IGF-1 and TGFbeta) in the 
      brain. Furthermore, the levels of matrix metalloproteinase-9, an enzyme shown to 
      degrade Abeta and is associated with glial scar formation, were significantly 
      elevated in the brain following immunization. Altogether, these results indicate 
      that boosting systemic immune cells leads to a local immunomodulation manifested by 
      elevated levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines and metalloproteinases that 
      contribute to ameliorating Alzheimer's disease pathology.

TI  - Can Antibodies Against Glial Derived Antigens be Early Biomarkers of Hippocampal 
      Demyelination and Memory Loss in Alzheimer's Disease?
PG  - 115-21
LID - 10.3233/JAD-150309 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is known to exhibit well characterized 
      pathologies including the extracellular accumulation of amyloid plaques, 
      intra-axonal presence of neurofibrillary tangles, and glial hypertrophy. 
      Nevertheless, the nature of myelin pathology in AD has not been well studied. Recent 
      studies on animal models of AD, however, revealed focal demyelination within 
      amyloid-β plaques in hippocampus. OBJECTIVES: In a view of this finding, we decided 
      to assess humoral response against proteins of myelin sheath in AD, in the hope of 
      identifying early biomarkers of memory loss and neuropathological process 
      characteristic of AD. METHODS: We assessed antibodies levels against proteins of the 
      myelin sheath: myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG), myelin basic protein 
      (MBP), myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG), and proteolipoprotein (PLP) in sera of 
      26 AD patients and 26 healthy controls, using commercially available ELISA system 
      (Mediagnost, Germany). RESULTS: In the AD patient subgroup, significantly higher 
      titers were observed for all types of assessed IgG autoantibodies compared to 
      healthy control subjects (anti-MOG, anti-MAG, anti-MBP, anti-PLP). The titers of 
      most of the investigated IgM antibodies were also higher in AD patients (p <  0.05), 
      with the exception of anti-MAG IgM antibodies (p >  0.05). CONCLUSION: The study 
      provides the evidence for the significantly increased production of autoantibodies 
      against proteins of myelin sheath in AD. These results can be of importance in the 
      light of emerging data from animal models of AD, indicating early demyelination of 
      hippocampal region. Further studies on larger population are necessary to confirm 
      whether these autoantibodies could serve as early biomarkers of AD in humans.

TI  - Infection of stationary human brain aggregates with HIV-1 SF162 and IIIB results in 
      transient neuronal damage and neurotoxicity.
PG  - 136-47
AB  - The cellular basis of HIV associated dementia has been correlated with microglial 
      activation and neuronal dysfunction in symptomatic HIV-1 disease. As a cellular 
      model of HIV-1 infection of brain tissue in vitro, we established a stationary human 
      brain aggregate (SHBA) system to compare infection of HIV-1 SF162 (R5 virus) to that 
      of IIIB (X4 virus). Aggregates were analysed by immunohistochemistry, morphometry, 
      flow cytometry and p24 ELISA. SHBAs had a 1 mm(3) size with a mixed cellular 
      composition of 36% neurones, 27% astrocytes, 2% macrophages/microglia and 14% 
      oligodendrocytes. Infection of SHBA's with the R5 HIV-1 SF162 virus led to the 
      expression of HIV-1 p24 antigen in 6% of cells. Infection with this R5 using virus 
      culminated in transient neuronal damage and a decrease in mitotically active 
      progenitor cells within aggregates. Infection with X4 using HIV-1 IIIB was 
      associated with astrocytosis and neurotoxicity. We propose that: (1) the pattern of 
      cellular damage elicited by HIV-1 infection of brain tissue in vitro depends on 
      virus subtype as determined by its preferential use of R5 or X4 chemokine receptors 
      for entry into cells; (2) SHBAs are a reliable and readily established model of the 
      cellular complexity of human brain tissue in vitro.

TI  - [Mixed hypotonia, neurological regression and atrophy of the cerebellum: 
      manifestations that suggest infantile neuroaxonal dystrophy].
PG  - 25-8
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Infantile neuroaxonal dystrophy (INAD), or Seitelberger disease, is a 
      neurodegenerative disease of unknown origin which is transmitted by autosomal 
      recessive inheritance. Clinically, it courses with psychomotor stagnation and 
      regression that begins at the age of one or two years, associated to hypotonia with 
      mixed clinical features (segmentary and suprasegmentary) that progresses towards 
      spastic tetraplegia and progressive optic atrophy and dementia; this leads to death 
      before the age of ten years. AIMS. To present the case of a 30 month old child with 
      INAD, in whom a N acetylgalactosaminidase deficiency and mitochondrial cytopathy 
      were ruled out. CASE REPORT: Male aged 30 months with an initial overall 
      retardation, and later regression, of psychomotor acquisitions. In the physical 
      exploration the patient displayed serious neurological involvement with mixed 
      hypotonia, muscular hypotrophy with generalised weakness and mild bilateral 
      horizontal nystagmus. Complementary explorations with neuroimaging revealed a slight 
      increase in the subarachnoid space, with atrophy of the vermis and cerebellar 
      hemispheres. Neurophysiological tests (EMG and ENG), which were initially normal, 
      later showed signs of denervation in the EMG, and the ENG revealed a decreased 
      amplitude of motor responses, with preservation of conduction speed. Histological 
      tests showed the presence of axons with axoplasm expanded by the inclusion of 
      typical tubulovascular structures. CONCLUSION: The clinical features of our patient 
      met all the criteria to satisfy a diagnosis of INAD, and he displayed a classic form 
      of the disease. INAD must be considered when the clinician is faced with: 1. A 
      clinical picture of stagnation and later regression of psychomotor development 
      before the age of two years; 2. Hypotonia, muscular atrophy and initial overall 
      areflexia, with later progression towards pyramidalism; 3. Initially normal EMG 
      findings, with later signs of denervation; 4. Cerebellar atrophy (hemispheres and 
      vermis); 5. Visual deficit, and 6. Histopathological proof of characteristic 
      findings.

TI  - Modifications of oligodendroglial cells in spongiform encephalopathies.
PG  - 23-30
AB  - Although gray matter lesions involving neurones and astrocytes are prominent in 
      human transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSE), white matter lesions have 
      also been occasionally observed. Secondary (Wallerian) degeneration and direct 
      myelin damage have been invoked, but the physiopathology of white matter involvement 
      is still debated. We performed an immunohistochemistry study with anti-PrP 
      antibodies of autopsy material of four patients with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease 
      (CJD), together with transmission electron microscopy (TEM) studies of 
      conventionally processed biopsy specimens of the same patients. Light microscopy 
      immunolabeling was observed as arrays adjacent to myelinic fibers and as a clumps 
      adjacent to oligodendroglial nuclei; both cerebrum and cerebellum were involved. At 
      the ultrastructural level, two types of intracellular inclusions were seen in the 
      white matter. They were associated with dense lysosomes in oligodendroglial 
      perikarya and in their processes. The inclusions were made of finely fibrillar, 
      paracrystalline, amorphous, or densely osmophilic material. Thus, our findings may 
      suggest that white matter involvement in spongiform encephalopathy is due to direct 
      modifications of oligodendroglial cell associated with abnormal metabolism of PrP.

TI  - Iron deposits in multiple sclerosis and Alzheimer's disease brains.
PG  - 298-303
AB  - Iron may contribute to the pathogenesis of neurological diseases by promoting 
      oxidative damage. The localization of iron in multiple sclerosis (MS) and 
      Alzheimer's disease (AD) brains was investigated to further the understanding of its 
      pathogenic role in these disease states. Earlier studies, utilizing a standard 
      Perls' stain, yielded conflicting reports regarding the distribution of iron 
      deposits in MS brains, and a previous study on AD brains utilized a diaminobenzidine 
      (DAB) enhanced version of this stain. In the present study, a modified version of 
      the DAB-enhanced stain was used; it utilizes sodium borohydride, proteinase K, 
      Triton X-100 and xylenes to increase the accessibility of tissue iron to 
      histochemical reagents. This modified method can reveal iron deposits that are 
      missed by the Perls' or DAB-enhanced Perls' stains. In addition to its normal 
      deposition in oligodendrocytes and myelin, iron was detected in reactive microglia, 
      ameboid microglia and macrophages in MS brains. In AD brains, three types of plaques 
      were stained: dense core, clear core and amorphous plaques. Punctate staining was 
      also observed in neurons in the corticies of AD brains. The structure accounting for 
      punctate labeling may be damaged mitochondria, lipofuscin or amyloid deposits. Dense 
      core plaques, clear plaques and punctate labeling were not detected in the previous 
      AD study which utilized only the DAB-enhanced Perls' stain. The labeling of these 
      additional structures illustrates the benefit of the modified method. In summary, 
      the localization of iron deposition in MS and AD brains indicates potential sites 
      where iron could promote oxidative damage in these disease states.

TI  - Regional distribution of brain gangliosides in Alzheimer's disease.
PG  - 269-81
AB  - In this study, brain gangliosides of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD, N = 5) 
      were analyzed and compared with control human brains (C, N = 3). Gangliosides were 
      analyzed in seven brain regions: cerebral cortex (frontal, parietal, temporal and 
      occipital), hippocampus, basal telencephalon and frontal white matter. The results 
      demonstrated gangliosides to be decreased in the majority of regions analyzed, 
      however, a significant decrease in gangliosides (nmol LBSA/mg proteins or g fresh 
      weight) in frontal cortex and white matter (P less than 0.05) was recorded. When 
      gangliosides were expressed in nmol LBSA/mg DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid), their basal 
      telencephalon, suggesting that high astroglial proliferation might have concealed 
      the real neuronal degeneration. In the ganglioside composition, all human brain 
      regions contained moderately decreased ganglio-series gangliosides (GT1b, GD1b, 
      GD1a, GM1) but a statistically significant decrease was detected in frontal cortex, 
      and white matter (nmol LBSA/g fresh weight) or frontal cortex, temporal cortex and 
      basal telencephalon (nmol LBSA/mg DNA). In addition, frontal and parietal cortex 
      also showed elevated concentration (nmol LBSA/g fresh weight) of simple gangliosides 
      (GM2, GM3, GM4, GD3). A decreased concentration of ganglio-series gangliosides in 
      Alzheimer's disease correlates with degeneration of cortical neurons. However, 
      elevation of simple gangliosides in frontal and parietal cortex may correlate with: 
      (a) an accelerated lysosomal degradation of gangliosides occurring during neuronal 
      death (GM2); (b) astrogliosis (GM3 and GD3); and (c) activation of oligodendrocytes 
      (GM4). The fact that gangliosides are altered in Alzheimer's disease might be 
      important for better understanding of the pathogenesis of the disease.

TI  - A histoquantitative study of the striate cortex and lateral geniculate body in 
      normal, blind and demented subjects.
PG  - 103-14
AB  - The amount of myelin in the outer band of Baillarger in the human visual cortex 
      stained by Luxol Fast Blue MBS, has been measured in normal individuals of wide age 
      range, in a group of blind and severely visually impaired but otherwise normal 
      individuals and in a series of demented patients of the Alzheimer and multi-infarct 
      type who were apparently visually normal. The amount of myelin is found to be 
      significantly reduced in the blind and demented groups. Examination of the lateral 
      geniculate body in the blind cases demonstrated slight reduction in neuron numbers 
      and marked reduction in mean neuron diameter. Neuronal cytoplasmic ribonucleic acid, 
      nucleolar volume and numbers of tetraploid glial nuclei in the blind or visually 
      impaired cases were significantly reduced when compared with controls, indicating 
      reduced function in these neurons. Similar results were obtained on examining this 
      nucleus in Alzheimer and multi-infarct cases, suggesting that the visual pathways 
      may be involved in these conditions. It is concluded that loss of myelin from the 
      outer band of Baillarger occurs in association with reduced function of neurons in 
      the lateral geniculate body.

TI  - Isolation and characterization of adult microglial cells and oligodendrocytes 
      derived from postmortem human brain tissue.
PG  - 85-94
AB  - The present study provides a detailed description of the simultaneous establishment 
      and immunocytochemical characterization of highly enriched human adult microglial 
      cell cultures as well as of oligodendrocyte cultures. For this study, brain tissue 
      specimens were collected at autopsy with relatively short postmortem times (3-9 h) 
      from various regions of the CNS of Alzheimer's disease, Pick's disease and 
      non-demented control cases. Although methods to isolate viable glial cells from 
      human adult brain tissue have been described, these human brain specimens were often 
      derived from surgical resections, i.e., in order to treat intractable epilepsy, 
      brain tumors or cardiovascular diseases involving the brain. However, for the study 
      of many neurological disorders, surgical material is not available. Furthermore, for 
      obvious reasons, there is a limit to the number of central nervous system (CNS) 
      regions from which (enough) tissue can be obtained at surgery. The adherent primary 
      microglial cells, isolated according to the here described procedures consisted of 
      proliferating, phagocytotic cells that expressed various 
      microglia/macrophage-specific markers as judged by immunocytochemical analysis. 
      Non-adherent cells isolated from the same brain tissue samples expressed 
      oligodendrocyte-specific markers. The current described culture system may provide a 
      valuable tool in studying human CNS biology and disease.

TI  - Neuronal localization of the TNFalpha converting enzyme (TACE) in brain tissue and 
      its correlation to amyloid plaques.
PG  - 40-6
AB  - The tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha converting enzyme (TACE) can cleave the 
      cell-surface ectodomain of the amyloid-beta precursor protein (APP), thus decreasing 
      the generation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) by cultured non-neuronal cells. While the 
      amyloidogenic processing of APP in neurons is linked to the pathogenesis of 
      Alzheimer's disease (AD), the expression of TACE in neurons has not yet been 
      examined. Thus, we assessed TACE expression in a series of neuronal and non-neuronal 
      cell types by Western blots. We found that TACE was present in neurons and was only 
      faintly detectable in lysates of astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and microglial cells. 
      Immunohistochemical analysis was used to determine the cellular localization of TACE 
      in the human brain, and its expression was detected in distinct neuronal 
      populations, including pyramidal neurons of the cerebral cortex and granular cell 
      layer neurons in the hippocampus. Very low levels of TACE were seen in the 
      cerebellum, with Purkinje cells at the granular-molecular boundary staining faintly. 
      Because TACE was localized predominantly in areas of the brain that are affected by 
      amyloid plaques in AD, we examined its expression in a series of AD brains. We found 
      that AD and control brains showed similar levels of TACE staining, as well as 
      similar patterns of TACE expression. By double labeling for Abeta plaques and TACE, 
      we found that TACE-positive neurons often colocalized with amyloid plaques in AD 
      brains. These observations support a neuronal role for TACE and suggest a mechanism 
      for its involvement in AD pathogenesis as an antagonist of Abeta formation.

TI  - Neuropathologic variation in frontotemporal dementia due to the intronic tau 10(+16) 
      mutation.
PG  - 1169-75
AB  - BACKGROUND: An increasing number of recently described tau mutations show 
      considerable clinical heterogeneity. The assessment of this phenotypic variation is 
      of vital importance in the differential diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases. 
      OBJECTIVE: To assess the neuropathologic heterogeneity in a comprehensive study of 
      12 brains with a tau mutation at exon 10(+16) (C-to-T) splice site from 9 families. 
      METHODS: A comprehensive neuropathologic examination has been carried out, using a 
      wide range of tau antibodies. RESULTS: All brains showed frontotemporal atrophy of 
      varying severity and pallor of the pigmented nuclei of the brainstem. The histologic 
      changes were more extensive to include other cortical areas, the deep gray matter, 
      and the white matter. The hallmark histologic lesions were the tau-positive neuronal 
      and glial inclusions. In neurons, these ranged from typical neurofibrillary tangles 
      through well-circumscribed inclusions to diffuse cytoplasmic staining. This tau 
      pathology was complemented by the presence of large, abnormal achromatic neurons, 
      neuronal loss, astrocytosis, and superficial status spongiosus. CONCLUSION: The 
      distribution, type, and severity of these histologic abnormalities varied not only 
      from case to case but also within the same brain. These brains with a common tau 
      mutation raise important differential diagnostic problems: cases in the past might 
      have been misdiagnosed as corticobasal degeneration or even atypical Pick disease, 
      disorders with similar, if not identical, phenotypic manifestations.

TI  - Immunocytochemical characterization of glial fibrillary tangles in Alzheimer's 
      disease brain.
PG  - 1052-8
AB  - Neurofibrillary tangle is a major cytoskeletal pathology in Alzheimer's disease 
      brains, and has been considered to develop exclusively in neuronal cells. We 
      examined brains with Alzheimer's disease and observed argyrophilic fibrillary 
      tangles not only in cortical neurons but also in subcortical glial cells in the 
      frontal and temporal white matter. The tangles in glial cells were immunolabeled by 
      antibodies against tau and ubiquitin, and double immunocytochemistry analyzed by 
      confocal laser scanning microscopy demonstrated that the cytoplasms of 
      tangle-bearing glia were labeled by antibodies against transferrin and 2'3'-cyclic 
      nucleotide 3'-phosphohydrolase. Ultrastructurally, they were made up of bundles of 
      straight filaments 16 nm in diameter and constricted filaments. These results 
      indicate that fibrillary tangles resembling neurofibrillary tangles may develop in 
      oligodendrocytes in brains with Alzheimer's disease and are distinguishable from 
      glial cytoplasmic inclusions observed in multiple system atrophy brains. We referred 
      to them as glial fibrillary tangles. Glial fibrillary tangles commonly occurred in 
      this disease condition, and glial cells might be involved under the pathological 
      processes similar to neuronal cells.

TI  - Astrocytes expressing hyperphosphorylated tau protein without glial fibrillary 
      tangles in argyrophilic grain disease.
PG  - 251-6
AB  - Argyrophilic grain disease (AgD), a frequent type of late onset dementia, is 
      characterized by the occurrence of Gallyas-stained neuropil grains in the 
      hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, amygdala and hypothalamus. High numbers of neurons 
      containing hyperphosphorylated tau protein, but devoid of tangles, are encountered 
      in areas rich in argyrophilic grains (ArGs). A third type of change consists of 
      slender argyrophilic and tau-immunoreactive cytoplasmic inclusions in white matter 
      oligodendrocytes, the coiled bodies. We now extend earlier studies on glial 
      pathology in AgD (20 cases) and compare the results with glial changes in old age 
      (10 cases) and Alzheimer's disease (AD; 7 cases). Numerous non-argyrophilic, 
      non-neuronal tau-positive stellate cells in the amygdala and anterior entorhinal 
      cortex were consistently found in all of the 20 AgD cases but not in AD cases. 
      Double-labelling experiments performed on paraffin sections with 
      phosphorylation-dependent anti-tau antibody AT8, anti-glial fibrillary acidic 
      protein and anti-CD44, revealed coexpression of these markers in stellate cells. The 
      high expression of CD44 indicate that they probably correspond to reactive 
      astrocytes. Unlike astrocytic plaques in corticobasal degeneration (CBD), where AT8 
      reactivity is accumulating in distal astrocytic processes, tau reactivity in AgD was 
      found in all astrocytic cell compartments. The absence of glial fibrillary tangles 
      further distinguished tau-labelled astrocytes in AgD from astrocytic plaques in CBD 
      and tufted astrocytes in progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP). In contrast to AD and 
      aged non-demented control cases tau-positive non-argyrophilic astrocytes represent a 
      consistent finding in anterior limbic structures in AgD. Our findings point to a 
      more widespread pathology of the glial cell population in AgD than previously 
      supposed, and will be of further help in differentiating AgD from other 
      neurodegenerative disorders, including AD, PSP, CBD and Pick's disease.

AB  - Tau lesions (pretangles, neuropil threads, neurofibrillary tangles) in select 
      neuronal types are essential to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. Pretangle 
      formation marks the beginning of the pathological process and is of particular 
      interest because it is temporally closer to the prevailing conditions that induce 
      the pathological process underlying Alzheimer's disease in contrast to late-stage 
      disease. However, not all pretangles convert into neurofibrillary tangles. We 
      propose that the development of tau lesions in Alzheimer's disease is traceable to 
      differences between early- versus late-maturing oligodendrocytes and to the 
      exceptionally protracted myelination of late-developing portions of the human brain. 
      Conclusions drawn from these considerations should encourage development of new 
      preventative and disease-modifying strategies.

TI  - Astrocytes in Alzheimer's disease express immunoreactivity to the vaso-constrictor 
      endothelin-1.
PG  - 90-6
AB  - The avidin-biotin peroxidase complex method and a polyclonal antiserum were used to 
      investigate the distribution of endothelin-1-like immunoreactivity of cerebral 
      astrocytes in autopsy cases of Alzheimer's disease compared with controls. The cases 
      of Alzheimer's disease presented numerous astrocytes with intense endothelin-1-like 
      immunoreactivity of the cell body often extending into the finest ramifications of 
      the cell processes. Absorption of the antiserum by the corresponding antigen 
      eliminated this immunostaining. The immunoreactive astrocytes were most consistently 
      present in the subcortical white matter of the cerebral hemispheres and the folia of 
      the cerebellum. The immunoreactive cells were often located in small clusters close 
      to blood vessels. Five of the seven cases showed immunoreactive astrocytes in the 
      molecular layer of the cerebral cortex and three of the seven cases presented 
      regions in which immunoreactive astrocytes appeared to be located in the periphery 
      of plaques. The pons contained small groups of immunoreactive astrocytes in five of 
      the cases. The cerebellum had such cells in six of the seven investigated patients. 
      Immunoreactive astrocytes were very rare in control cases without cerebral disease. 
      Many nerve cells in the cerebral neocortex, hippocampus, cerebellum and pons of 
      Alzheimer cases and controls exhibited endothelin-1-like immunoreactivity. 
      Oligodendrocytes and endothelial cells of blood vessels of controls and Alzheimer 
      cases did not show such immunoreactivity. The expression of endothelin-1-like 
      immunoreactivity in astrocytes of Alzheimer's disease probably reflects an increased 
      content of endothelin-1. If endothelin-1 is released from such astrocytes it may 
      reach smooth muscle cells of the intracerebral blood vessels and disturb 
      micro-circulation since this compound is a most powerful vasoconstrictor peptide.

TI  - [Arteriopathic leukoencephalopathy (17 anatomo-clinical cases)].
PG  - 93-108
AB  - Seventeen clinico-pathological cases of leukoencephalopathy due to vascular diseases 
      are reported. All of them had diffuse, often spotty demyelination sparing the U 
      fibers, the corpus callosum, the internal capsule and the optic radiations. 
      Microscopic examination of the white matter showed the association of the following 
      lesions: oedema, swollen oligodendroglia, spongiosis, incomplete loss of myelin, 
      astrocytic gliosis with Rosenthal's fibers, widening of the perivascular spaces with 
      oedema fluid or hemosiderin laden macrophages, thickening and hyalinization of the 
      blood vessels walls. Among those cases, 8 were consistent with Binswanger's 
      subcortical encephalopathy (5 males, 3 females, mean age at death: 64 years, mean 
      illness duration: 6, 7 years); all of them were hypertensive and had lacunae in the 
      basal ganglia, hemispheric white matter and pons. Another case could be considered 
      as a cortico-subcortical chronic hypertensive encephalopathy (77 y.o., female, 
      illness duration: 4 years); she was hypertensive and had small cortical infarcts and 
      perivascular bleedings, lobar and cerebellar hematomas, but no amyloid deposits in 
      the blood vessels walls. Eight patients (5 males, 3 females mean age at death: 72 
      years, mean illness duration: 5, 4 years, 6 normotensive, 2 hypertensive) had 
      diffuse meningocortical amyloid angiopathy with multiple small cortical infarcts, 
      small cortical perivascular bleedings, slit haemorrhages and one or more lobar 
      hematomas. Four of them had numerous senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. To 
      our knowledge such a leukoencephalopathy in cerebral amyloid angiopathy has not been 
      yet pointed out. It was present in 8 out of 12 cases of diffuse haemorrhagic form of 
      cerebral amyloid angiopathy observed in the Charles Foix Laboratory of la 
      Salpêtrière, during the last 10 years. A common mechanism with hypoperfusion of the 
      distal white matter and alteration of the blood brain-barrier is suggested for this 
      leukoencephalopathy.

TI  - The second layer neurones of the entorhinal cortex and the perforant path in 
      physiological ageing and Alzheimer's disease.
PG  - 47-53
AB  - The hippocampal formation was studied in 5 brains of younger (29 to 52 years of age) 
      and 6 brains of elderly (61 to 89 years of age) subjects without signs of dementia, 
      as well as in 11 brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease (65 to 91 years of 
      age). The 8-microns-thick sections were stained either with cresyl violet, Weil 
      method or with immunocytochemical methods for amyloid (4G8) and neurofibrillary 
      tangles (Tau-1). Cell bodies, senile plaques and tangles were counted in all brains. 
      In brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease a significant neuronal loss (about 
      56%) was observed in the second layer of the entorhinal cortex. The tangles/neurones 
      ratio was very high (62.79.1%) in this layer. A great number of senile plaques were 
      present in the whole hippocampal formation, especially in the molecular layer of the 
      dentate gyrus (22.91.5 plaques/mm2) which is the termination zone of the perforant 
      path. It seems therefore, that pathological alterations in Alzheimer's disease 
      disrupt the main input to the hippocampal formation. In "physiological" ageing we 
      did not observe changes in the density of neurones, although single tangles and 
      plaques were found in all hippocampal areas. In elderly individuals 3.81.3% of 
      neurones of the second layer revealed neurofibrillary pathology; a few plaques were 
      found in various areas of the hippocampal formation. These observations may suggest 
      only a slight decrease in number of neurones in the hippocampal formation. However, 
      these changes cause a slight impairment of memory and learning often found in 
      elderly individuals without dementia.

TI  - Interaction of medial temporal lobe atrophy and white matter hyperintensities in AD.
PG  - 1862-4
AB  - The authors investigated the interaction between medial temporal lobe (MTL) atrophy 
      and white matter hyperintensities (WMH) in Alzheimer disease (AD). They measured the 
      MTL and WMH on MRI in 58 AD patients and 28 controls. MTL atrophy was associated 
      with an increased risk of AD (OR = 6.2), but there was no significant association 
      between WMH and AD. Moreover, there was an interaction between MTL and WMH (p = 
      0.045). These results suggest that vascular and Alzheimer-type pathology act in 
      synergy in the clinical syndrome of AD.

PG  - 1002-5
LID - 10.1111/j.1468-1331.2008.02220.x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We investigated whether patients with a lacunar infarct (LI) 
      syndrome exhibiting unique LI or multiple LI on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 
      examinations differed in terms of topography and severity of white matter 
      hyperintensities (WMH) ratings. METHODS: Forty consecutive patients with a 
      first-ever acute LI, who presented a lacunar syndrome according to Miller-Fisher's 
      classification were recruited and were classified into a group presenting isolated 
      LI on MRI (n = 17) or multiple LI (n = 23). RESULTS: Despite equivalent demographic, 
      clinical and cognitive characteristics, patients with multiple LI had increased 
      ratings of WMH in frontal, occipital and subcortical regions. No significant 
      correlations could be evidenced between the number of LI and WMH ratings. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Present findings provide support to previous hypothesis considering 
      single and multiple LI MRI presentations of lacunar infarct patients as distinct 
      entities.

AB  - An autopsy case of familial juvenile Alzheimer's disease with extensive involvement 
      of the subcortical gray and white matters is reported. A 33-year-old woman showed a 
      progressive dementia and died of cardiac failure at the age of 45. Neurological 
      examination disclosed choreatic movements, myoclonus, rigidity, and generalized 
      convulsion. Gross inspection of the brain showed a diffuse cerebral atrophy and 
      marked degenerations of both the subcortical gray and white matters. 
      Microscopically, numerous and extensive argyrophilic changes such as senile plaques, 
      neurofibrillary tangles, and granulovacuolar degenerations were observed in the 
      brain. The present case was characterized by a severe neuronal loss in the basal 
      ganglia, substantia nigra, dentate nucleus, and thalamus as well as a marked myelin 
      loss and axonal damage in the cerebral white matter. This case suggested a 
      combination of multisystemic degeneration and primary degeneration of the cerebral 
      white matter. The pathological similarity of this case to Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease 
      and Pick's disease is discussed.

AB  - A 72-year-old woman presented with first onset of seizure with no prior history of 
      cognitive dysfunction. EEG revealed focal non-convulsive status epilepticus. MRI 
      brain showed a left temporal non-enhancing lesion. Temporal pole biopsy showed acute 
      neuronal necrosis and astrocyte hyperplasia together with extensive amyloid plaques 
      and neurofibrillary tangles. Perivascular oligodendroglial hyperplasia was present. 
      Postmortem examination revealed extensive plaque and tangle disease. Perivascular 
      oligodendroglial hyperplasia was limited to the left temporal area. The presence of 
      focal perivascular oligodendroglial hyperplasia in the left temporal cortex, 
      combined with extensive plaque and tangle disease may have contributed to the focal 
      status epilepticus in this patient. Although the presence of focal perivascular 
      oligodendroglial hyperplasia has been reported in cases of temporal lobe epilepsy, 
      it has not been reported as a cause of seizure in patients with Alzheimer's disease 
      previously. Further studies for clinical-pathologic correlation would be required to 
      confirm this hypothesis.

TI  - Synthetic peptides in the diagnosis of neurological diseases.
PG  - 277-84
AB  - For several years peptides have been used to investigate many aspects of the 
      molecular mechanisms supporting the etiopathogenesis of neurological diseases. Even 
      if well-established and commercially-available assays for the diagnosis of 
      neurological diseases, based on peptides, are presently not available, much research 
      has been focused to the comprehension of the pathogenetic mechanisms of relevant 
      neurological diseases, such as Multiple Sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease and prion 
      diseases. Several peptides, which strongly contributed to increase in the progress, 
      and in the understanding of the molecular mechanisms of these important diseases, 
      have been selected as antigens to be proposed in possible alternative diagnostic 
      methodologies. The authors focused their attention on the possible peptides to be 
      used as diagnostics for these three characteristic neurological diseases. In fact, 
      Multiple Sclerosis is an autoimmune disease in which peptides have been used for the 
      characterization of both B and T immune response, while Alzheimer's disease and 
      prion diseases can be cumulative regarded as "protein folding disorders" in which 
      peptides can be used to identify the misfolded protein.

TI  - Molecular, cellular, and pathologic characterization of HLA-DR immunoreactivity in 
      normal elderly and Alzheimer's disease brain.
PG  - 93-104
AB  - Previous studies have suggested that markers of immune function may be present in 
      brain. We have characterized one of the most important of these markers, the human 
      major histocompatibility complex antigen HLA-DR, at molecular, cellular, and 
      pathologic levels. The results show that an antigen with the correct molecular 
      weight for HLA-DR and the appropriate immunoreactivity for HLA-DR monoclonal 
      antibodies is present in nondemented elderly (ND) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain 
      tissue. HLA-DR immunoreactivity is profusely expressed by brain microglia, often 
      expressed by lymphocytes within the neuropil, rarely expressed by astrocytes, and 
      not expressed by neurons or oligodendrocytes. Pathologically, HLA-DR-like staining 
      in ND patients is confined primarily to white matter nonreactive or resting 
      microglia. In AD patients, both white matter and gray matter are stained, and 
      HLA-DR-positive reactive microglia predominate. Virtually all senile or neuritic 
      plaques are densely HLA-DR immunoreactive: at the plaque core staining intensity is 
      elevated as much as 50-fold, dropping to background at the plaque margin.

TI  - Characterization of ubiquitinated intraneuronal inclusions in a novel Belgian 
      frontotemporal lobar degeneration family.
PG  - 289-301
AB  - The most common histologic feature in patients with frontotemporal lobar 
      degeneration (FTLD) is intracellular brain inclusions of yet uncharacterized 
      proteins that react with antiubiquitin (Ub) antibodies, but not with tau or 
      synuclein (FTLD-U). We identified a four-generation Belgian FTLD family in which 8 
      patients had dominantly inherited FTLD. In one patient, we showed frontotemporal 
      atrophy with filamentous Ub-positive intracellular inclusions in absence of tau 
      pathology or any alterations in the levels of soluble tau. We characterized the 
      cellular and subcellular localization and morphology of the inclusions. Ub-positive 
      inclusions predominantly occurred within neurons (>97%), but were also observed 
      within oligodendroglia (approximately 2%) and microglia (<1%), but not within 
      astroglia. Regarding the subcellular localization, the intranuclear inclusions (INI) 
      were up to approximately four-fold more frequent than the cytoplasmic inclusions, 
      although the latter were more specific to neurons. The INIs frequently appeared 
      spindle-shaped and 3-dimensional confocal reconstructions identified flattened, 
      leaf-like structures. Ultrastructurally, straight 10- to 18-nm-diameter filaments 
      constituted the spindle-shaped inclusions that occurred in close proximity to the 
      nuclear membrane. Staining for HSP40, p62, and valosin/p97 was observed in only a 
      minority of the inclusions. Whereas the precise nature of the protein remains 
      elusive, characterization of such familial FTLD-U patients would be helpful in 
      identifying a common denominator in the pathogenesis of familial and the more 
      prevalent sporadic FTLD-U.

TI  - Neuroglia in the inferior olivary nucleus during normal aging and Alzheimer's 
      disease.
PG  - 145-56
AB  - It is likely that neuronal loss occurs in certain brain regions in Alzheimer's 
      Disease (AD) without any neurofibrillary pathology. In the human principle inferior 
      olivary nucleus (PO), we have shown that neuronal loss is about 34% (Lasn et al. 
      Journal of Alzheimer Disease, 2001; 3: 159-168), but the fate of the neuroglial 
      cells is unknown. Since the unique network of neurons and neuroglial cells and their 
      cohabitation are essential for normal functioning of CNS, we designed a study to 
      estimate the total number of oligodendrocytes and astrocytes in normally aged and AD 
      brains. The study is based on 10 control and 11 AD post-mortem human brains. An 
      unbiased stereological fractionator method was used. We found significant 
      oligodendroglial cell loss (46%) in AD as compared to control brains, while the 
      total number of astrocytes showed a tendency to decrease. It is likely that the 
      ratio of oligodendroglial cells to neurons remains unchanged even in degenerative 
      states, indicating that oligodendroglial cells parallel neuronal loss. Astroglial 
      cells did not increase in total number, but the ratio to neurons was significantly 
      increased due to the neuronal loss. Using a novel unbiased quantitative method, we 
      were able to describe significant oligodendroglial loss in the PO but the pathogenic 
      mechanism behind remains unknown.

TI  - Expression of alpha B-crystallin in Alzheimer's disease.
PG  - 155-60
AB  - alpha B-crystallin is a member of the small heat-shock protein family. Under 
      pathological conditions, the expression of alpha B-crystallin increases in 
      proliferating astrocytes, which suggests that this protein, in addition to glial 
      fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), can be a marker for gliosis in neurodegenerative 
      diseases. Immunoblotting and immunohistochemical methods were used for the detection 
      of alpha B-crystallin in the brains of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients and 
      nondemented controls. An increase in alpha B-crystallin expression was found in the 
      brains of AD patients. Immunoreaction was present in reactive astrocytes, microglia, 
      and oligodendrocytes, indicating that all types of glia respond to the stress 
      associated with AD pathology. Colocalization of GFAP and alpha B-crystallin was 
      found in fibrous astrocytes. However, the intensity and range of alpha B-crystallin 
      expression appeared to be limited as compared with the large increase in the number 
      of GFAP-positive astrocytes. This indicates that expression of alpha B-crystallin is 
      not a marker for gliosis in AD. Immunoreactivity to alpha B-crystallin in both 
      astrocytes and microglia was found mainly restricted to areas with senile plaques 
      and neurofibrillary tangles, suggesting the association of alpha B-crystallin with 
      amyloid deposition in AD.

TI  - Oligodendroglial microtubular masses: an abnormality observed in some human 
      neurodegenerative diseases.
PG  - 163-6
AB  - Oligodendroglial microtubular masses (OMMs) were identified immunohistochemically in 
      brain tissue from patients with such degenerative disorders as Alzheimer disease, 
      Pick's disease and argyrophilic grain dementia. The OMMs were identified by Alz-50 
      and antibodies to Tau-2, paired helical filaments and ubiquitin. They occurred 
      preferentially in white matter. They were composed of fibers 25 nm in diameter and 
      were localized to the cytoplasma of oligodendroglia and processes of oligodendroglia 
      ensheathing damaged axons. They sometimes occurred in oligodendroglia also stained 
      by antibody to the complement protein C4d. These data suggest that OMMs represent 
      abnormal microtubular accumulations in oligodendroglia, possibly as a reaction to 
      axonal damage.

TI  - Arterial changes in cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical 
      infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) in relation to pathogenesis of diffuse 
      myelin loss of cerebral white matter: examination of cerebral medullary arteries by 
      reconstruction of serial sections of an autopsy case.
PG  - 2565-9
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: There is little information regarding the pathogenesis 
      underlying diffuse myelin loss in the cerebral white matter and sparing of the U 
      fibers in cerebral autosomal-dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and 
      leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL), in which the medial smooth muscle cells of systemic 
      arteries are characteristically involved. We sought to examine the precise extent 
      and severity of changes in the cerebral arteries in an autopsy case of CADASIL in 
      relation to pathogenesis of the diffuse myelin loss. METHODS: We reconstructed 1000 
      serial sections of the frontal cerebral medullary arteries of an autopsy subject, 
      which was the first identified Japanese case of CADASIL, as confirmed by the 
      presence of ultrastructural deposits of granular osmiophilic material in the media 
      of some visceral arteries and by genetic analysis. RESULTS: We reconstructed 11 
      medullary arteries of the frontal lobe showing diffuse myelin loss and atrophy of 
      the white matter with sparing of the U fibers. All of these showed complete loss of 
      medial smooth muscle cells over their entire length and severe adventitial fibrosis. 
      Although intimal fibrosis or hyalinosis was present, luminal occlusion was scarce. 
      These changes were also observed in the small and large arachnoidal arteries but 
      were relatively mild in the latter and in the cortical and subcortical medullary 
      arteries. CONCLUSIONS: These arterial changes resulted in transformation of the 
      cerebral arteries, in particular almost all the medullary arteries, to a so-called 
      earthen pipe state. This supports the reported findings of a reduction in vascular 
      reactivity to fluctuations in CO2 levels and systemic blood pressure in CADASIL.

      tracts in Alzheimer's disease.
PG  - 64-71

AB  - Post-mortem and imaging studies have observed that white matter (WM) degenerates in 
      a pattern inverse to myelin development, suggesting preferential regional 
      vulnerabilities influencing cognitive decline in AD. This study applied novel WM 
      tract integrity (WMTI) metrics derived from diffusional kurtosis imaging (DKI) to 
      examine WM tissue properties in AD within this framework. Using data from amnestic 
      mild cognitive impairment (aMCI, n = 12), AD (n = 14), and normal control (NC; 
      n = 15) subjects, mixed models revealed interaction effects: specific WMTI metrics 
      of axonal density and myelin integrity (i.e. axonal water fraction, radial 
      extra-axonal diffusivity) in late-myelinating tracts (i.e. superior and inferior 
      longitudinal fasciculi) changed in the course of disease, but were stable in the 
      initial stages for early-myelinating tracts (i.e. posterior limb of the internal 
      capsule, cerebral peduncles). WMTI metrics in late-myelinating tracts correlated 
      with semantic verbal fluency, a cognitive function known to decline in AD. These 
      findings corroborate the preferential vulnerability of late-myelinating tracts, and 
      illustrate an application of WMTI metrics to characterizing the regional course of 
      WM changes in AD.

TI  - Detection and localisation of HIV-1 DNA and RNA in fixed adult AIDS brain by 
      polymerase chain reaction/in situ hybridisation technique.
PG  - 481-7
AB  - In the brain of patients with AIDS, HIV-1 is localised in a productive form in 
      mononuclear cells. One issue that still needs clarification is whether HIV is 
      localised in cells other than those of mononuclear lineage. Gene amplification by 
      polymerase chain reaction/in situ hybridisation (PCR-IS) could shed light on it. In 
      this study, formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded brain tissue from ten adult AIDS 
      sufferers was used. Five of them showed evidence of HIV encephalitis (HIVE), five 
      did not show any abnormality. Nested PCR revealed HIV-1 DNA in all HIVE cases and in 
      three of the group without HIVE. HIV-1 DNA and RNA were also detected in situ in 
      seven cases (all seven were also HIV-1 DNA positive in tube). A higher signal was 
      located in the white than in the grey matter. HIV-1 DNA was found in microglia, 
      macrophages, perivascular cells, multinucleated gaint cells (MGC) and in 
      CD68-negative cells. Some of them were identified as endothelial cells, astrocytes 
      and oligodendrocytes. Reverse transcriptase-PCR-IS was positive in macrophages, MGC, 
      endothelial and glial cells. These results confirm infection of endothelial cells 
      and other glial cells and give clues about the route of entry of virus into the 
      central nervous system and the pathogenesis of the disease. This study did not give 
      any convincing evidence supporting an infection of neurons by HIV-1.

TI  - New immunocytochemical evidence for a neuronal/oligodendroglial origin for corpora 
      amylacea.
PG  - 66-73
AB  - Studies employing a bank of antisera applied to sections of LR White embedded AD and 
      normal ageing brain tissue, may throw new light on the derivation of CA. Conspicuous 
      levels of immunoreactivity were found in the CA of both tissues with markers for 
      oligodendrocytic proteins such as antisera against myelin basic proteolipid protein, 
      galactocerebroside and myelin/oligodendrocyte glycoprotein. CA were unreactive with 
      MRC OX-42, a marker for microglia and macrophages. In a previous publication we 
      demonstrated that the much more abundant CA in the brains of Alzheimer's disease 
      (AD) sufferers, although slightly more varied in their immunoreactivity than those 
      found in normally ageing controls, were universally immunoreactive with anti-tau, a 
      neuronally derived protein and often also contained amyloid. The cores of CA were 
      not immunoreactive with anti-GFAP, suggesting a lack of involvement with astrocytes. 
      Our results now show that in addition to amyloid and neuronal proteins, a 
      significant proportion of the content of CA is derived from oligodendrocytes and/or 
      myelin. The substantial Fe peak previously reported following X-ray microanalysis of 
      CA was probably due to ferritin. However, immunostaining with antisera to ferritin 
      showed that high ferritin immunoreactivity was common to both micro- and macroglia 
      as well as CA. More significantly, the immunoreactivity of CA with anti-ubiquitin 
      suggests that degeneration of neuronal/oligodendrocytic elements may precede CA 
      formation.

TI  - [The role of apolipoprotein E in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease].
PG  - 2673-7
AB  - Alzheimer disease (AD) is by far the most common cause of dementia in humans. 
      Massive accumulation of senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles are 
      characteristic neuropathological manifestations of the disease. Recent 
      investigations have revealed the presence of apolipoprotein E (apoE) in these 
      structures. Furthermore, APOE4, a specific allele of the apoE gene, is frequently 
      associated with sporadic AD and late-onset familial AD. Now, APOE4 has been 
      established as being a major risk factor for AD. Although apoE is one of numerous 
      plasma lipoproteins, it is of particular interest because, unlike other lipoproteins 
      that are mainly synthesized in the liver, apoE is also synthesized in astrocytes and 
      oligodendrocytes in the central nervous system. Furthermore, apoE plays an important 
      role in the regeneration and degeneration of neurons. Recent studies have indicated 
      the possibility that APOE4 accelerates the deposition of amyloid beta protein, which 
      is a major component of senile plaques in AD brains.

TI  - Myelin basic protein in Alzheimer disease neuronal fractions and mammalian 
      neurofilament preparations.
PG  - 429-36
AB  - We previously reported a marked increase of a 20,000 molecular weight (MW) protein, 
      P20, in some neuronal fractions and whole cortical homogenates isolated from 
      affected cortex in Alzheimer disease; P20 comigrated electrophoretically with an 
      unidentified, major 20,000 MW protein present in human neurofilament (NF) fractions. 
      We now report that the 20,000 MW protein is a major constituent of rodent as well as 
      human NF fractions and that it comigrates by one- and two-dimensional gel 
      electrophoresis with purified myelin basic protein (MBP). Peptide mapping and 
      staining with amido black confirmed the identity of the 20,000 MW protein of 
      mammalian NF fractions as MBP. One- and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of 
      neuronal perikaryal fractions from human cortex indicated that the increased P20 
      protein in Alzheimer neuronal fractions comigrates with human MBP. Deliberate 
      contamination of cortical samples with adjacent subcortical white matter (i.e., 
      myelin) prior to neuronal separation did not result in an increase of P20 in the 
      neuronal fraction. On the basis of these and additional experiments, we conclude 
      that the increase of a 20,000 MW protein in neuronal fractions and whole homogenates 
      from affected cortex in Alzheimer disease represents MBP of intracortical origin.

      dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) is 
      more common than previously thought. Deposits of granular osmiophilic material (GOM) 
      have been shown in the wall of retinal arterioles, though retinal infarcts and 
      vascular occlusions have never been reported. Ischaemic optic neuropathy, on the 
      other hand, has been reported in one case of CADASIL but no pathology reports of the 
      optic nerve have been published. Here we report optic nerve morphological findings 
      in the autopsy material of a 41-year-old woman with genetically assessed CADASIL. 
      Longitudinal and transverse sections of optic nerves were examined. Classical 
      histological methods (haematoxylin-eosin and Nissl) were performed. Diffuse pallor 
      of myelin and rarefaction of optic nerve fibres were observed. Classical GOM was 
      evident in the tunica media of vessels in the meninges and white matter. Arteriole 
      lumina were slightly narrowed. In conclusion, the typical pathological changes of 
      CADASIL occur in the optic nerve and may contribute to impairment of visual function 
      in CADASIL.

TI  - MRI measures of corpus callosum iron and myelin in early Huntington's disease.
PG  - 3143-51
LID - 10.1002/hbm.22391 [doi]
AB  - Increased iron in subcortical gray matter (GM) structures of patients with 
      Huntington's disease (HD) has been suggested as a causal factor in neuronal 
      degeneration. But how iron content is related to white matter (WM) changes in HD is 
      still unknown. For example, it is not clear whether WM changes share the same 
      physiopathology (i.e. iron accumulation) with GM or whether there is a different 
      mechanism. The present study used MRI to examine iron content in premanifest gene 
      carriers (PreHD, n = 25) and in early HD patients (n = 25) compared with healthy 
      controls (n = 50). 3T MRI acquisitions included high resolution 3D T1, EPI sequences 
      for diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) as an indirect measure of tissue integrity, and 
      T2*-weighted gradient echo-planar imaging for MR-based relaxometry (R2*), which 
      provides an indirect measure of ferritin/iron deposition in the brain. Myelin 
      breakdown starts in the PreHD stage, but there is no difference in iron content 
      values. Iron content reduction manifests later, in the early HD stage, in which we 
      found a lower R2* parameter value in the isthmus. The WM iron reduction in HD is 
      temporally well-defined (no iron differences in PreHD subjects and iron differences 
      only in early HD patients). Iron level in callosal WM may be regarded as a marker of 
      disease state, as iron does not differentiate PreHD subjects from controls but 
      distinguishes between PreHD and HD.

TI  - A novel population of progenitor cells expressing cannabinoid receptors in the 
      subependymal layer of the adult normal and Huntington's disease human brain.
PG  - 210-5
AB  - Progenitor cells in the adult human brain subependymal layer are capable of 
      producing new neurons and glial cells that may be useful as a source of cells for 
      endogenous cell replacement for regions of the brain that undergo degeneration due 
      to a neurodegenerative disease such as Huntington's disease, Parkinson's disease or 
      Alzheimer's disease. We have previously demonstrated that in the human Huntington's 
      disease brain there are increased numbers of progenitor cells proportional to the 
      severity of the gene defect responsible for the disease and proportional to the 
      severity of the pathology of the disease. One of the criticisms of a potential 
      endogenous progenitor cell replacement therapy has been that the endogenous 
      progenitor cells also contain the Huntington's disease gene and would therefore be 
      just as susceptible to degeneration as those in the degenerate brain region. In the 
      present study we have demonstrated the presence of cannabinoid CB1 receptors, which 
      are preferentially lost in Huntington's disease, colocalised with the proliferative 
      marker PCNA in the adult normal and Huntington's disease subependymal layer. This 
      population of CB1 positive cells only colabels with PCNA and not with neuronal, 
      glial, microglial or oligodendrocyte markers. These results indicate that the 
      subependymal layer in Huntington's disease contains a subpopulation of proliferating 
      cells that are also CB1 receptor positive and are thus not immediately susceptible 
      to the neurodegenerative process that denudes the striatum of CB1 receptors. This 
      finding raises the intriguing possibility that these cells could provide a suitable 
      source of cells for the endogenous replacement of cells lost due to 
      neurodegenerative disease.

TI  - In vitro evidence for a dual role of tumor necrosis factor-alpha in human 
      immunodeficiency virus type 1 encephalopathy.
PG  - 381-94
AB  - Microglial cell activation, myelin alteration, and abundant tumor necrosis factor 
      (TNF)-alpha message have been observed in the brains of some human immunodeficiency 
      virus type 1 (HIV-1)-infected and demented patients. We therefore used cultures of 
      purified human microglia and oligodendrocytes derived from adult human brain to 
      examine the role of TNF-alpha in HIV-1 encephalopathy. Human microglia synthesize 
      TNF-alpha message and protein in vitro. When these cells were infected with HIV-1 
      JrFL and maintained in the presence of TNF-alpha antibodies, soluble TNF-alpha 
      receptors, or the TNF-alpha inhibitor pentoxifylline, viral replication was delayed 
      or strongly inhibited. Both human microglia and oligodendrocytes express the two TNF 
      receptors, TNF-R1, which has been implicated in cytotoxicity, and TNF-R2. While 
      TNF-alpha may enhance HIV-1 replication in an autocrine manner, it is not toxic for 
      microglia. In contrast, recombinant human TNF-alpha causes oligodendrocyte death in 
      a dose-dependent manner. In situ detection of DNA fragmentation in some cells 
      indicated that oligodendrocyte death may occur by apoptosis. Addition of live 
      microglia or medium conditioned by these cells also resulted in 30 to 40% 
      oligodendrocyte death, which was largely prevented by TNF-alpha inhibitors. We 
      propose that TNF-alpha plays a dual role in HIV-1 encephalopathy, enhancing viral 
      replication by activated microglia and damaging oligodendrocytes. Thus, TNF-alpha 
      inhibitors may alleviate some of the neurological manifestations of acquired 
      immunodeficiency syndrome.

TI  - Differential expression of interferon-gamma receptor on human glial cells in vivo 
      and in vitro.
PG  - 91-9
LID - 10.1016/j.jneuroim.2010.04.023 [doi]
AB  - Although significant effects of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) on glial cells are well 
      documented, information on the expression level and localization of glial IFN-gamma 
      receptors (IFN-gamma-R) in the human central nervous system (CNS) is sparse. To 
      examine the glial expression of IFN-gamma-R in the human CNS, immunohistochemistry 
      and quantitative analyses were performed on Alzheimer disease hippocampus, Parkinson 
      disease substantia nigra, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis spinal cord and 
      corresponding areas from non-neurological cases. Almost all IFN-gamma-R-positive 
      (IFN-gamma-R(+)) cells corresponded to GFAP-positive (GFAP(+)) astrocytes, while 
      none of IFN-gamma-R(+) cells corresponded to IBA1-positive (IBA1(+)) microglia or 
      MBP-positive (MBP(+)) oligodendrocytes in these neurological cases. We observed a 
      similar pattern of glial IFN-gamma-R expression in non-neurological cases. Also, we 
      quantitatively analyzed the IFN-gamma-R expression by cultured human glial cells 
      using immunocytochemistry and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction 
      (RT-PCR). In contrast to in vivo results, almost all IFN-gamma-R(+) cells were 
      IBA1(+) in microglial cultures, GFAP(+) in astrocytic cultures and MBP(+) in 
      oligodendrocytic cultures. Moreover, no significant difference in IFN-gamma-R mRNA 
      expression was found for these glial cell types by RT-PCR. These results suggest 
      that the microglial and oligodendrocytic expression levels of IFN-gamma-R are much 
      lower than the astrocytic expression levels in the human CNS in vivo, whereas all 
      three types of glial cells constitutively express IFN-gamma-R when cultured in 
      vitro.

TI  - White matter changes in dementia of Alzheimer's type: the difference in 
      vulnerability between cell compartments.
PG  - 433-9
AB  - Structural white matter changes were found to be common in dementia of Alzheimer's 
      type. A neuropathological investigation was undertaken in order to characterize and 
      quantify these white matter changes. The tissue changes were compared with those in 
      white matter in normal control cases and in complete white matter infarcts. Our 
      results support the hypothesis that the white matter lesion seen in dementia of 
      Alzheimer's type is due to incomplete infarction involving both axons and myelin and 
      is a result of mild ischaemia. In mild ischaemia, the myelin compartment appears to 
      be the most vulnerable. We have termed the lesion selective incomplete white matter 
      infarction.

TI  - Immunohistochemical localization of NUB1, a synphilin-1-binding protein, in 
      neurodegenerative disorders.
PG  - 365-71
AB  - Recently, we showed that NUB1 is a synphilin-1-interacting protein and that NUB1, as 
      well as synphilin-1, accumulates in Lewy bodies in Parkinson's disease (PD) and 
      dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), and glial cytoplasmic inclusions in multiple system 
      atrophy (MSA). In this study, an investigation was further conducted to elucidate 
      the immunohistochemical localization of NUB1 in various neurodegenerative disorders. 
      In controls, anti-NUB1 antibody weakly immunolabeled neuronal perikarya. In PD and 
      DLB, cortical and brainstem-type Lewy bodies, pale bodies and Lewy neurites were 
      strongly immunolabeled with anti-NUB1. In MSA, NUB1 immunoreactivity was found in 
      the intracytoplasmic inclusions of both neuronal and oligodendroglial cells, 
      neuronal nuclear inclusions, and swollen neurites. No NUB1 immunoreactivity was 
      found in a variety of other neuronal or glial inclusions in other disorders, 
      including Alzheimer's disease, Pick's disease, progressive supranuclear palsy, 
      corticobasal degeneration, motor neuron disease and triplet-repeat diseases. These 
      findings indicate that the abnormal accumulation of NUB1 is specific for 
      alpha-synucleinopathy lesions. However, yeast two-hybrid assay demonstrated that 
      NUB1 did not directly interact with alpha-synuclein.

TI  - Peripheral neuropathy in CADASIL.
PG  - 1206-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and 
      leucoencephalopathy (CADASIL) is a hereditary cerebral microangiopathy associated 
      with mutations in the Notch 3 gene. The clinical phenotype is characterized by 
      cerebral impairment even though typical microvascular changes are diffuse. 
      OBJECTIVE: To assess peripheral neuropathy in patients with CADASIL. PATIENTS AND 
      METHODS: We enrolled eleven CADASIL patients with variable phenotype including 
      clinical signs of peripheral nerve involvement. In all patients electromyography and 
      nerve conduction velocities were performed. Peripheral nerve biopsy was performed in 
      three cases. RESULTS: We found sensory motor neuropathy in 7/11 patients. Nerve 
      biopsy revealed axonal and demyelinated findings. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest 
      that peripheral neuropathy may be part of the CADASIL phenotype.

TI  - Proteasome inhibition stabilizes tau inclusions in oligodendroglial cells that occur 
      after treatment with okadaic acid.
PG  - 8872-80
AB  - Tau-positive inclusions in oligodendrocytes are consistent neuropathological 
      features of corticobasal degeneration, progressive supranuclear palsy, and 
      frontotemporal dementias with Parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17. Here we show by 
      immunohistochemistry that tau-positive oligodendroglial inclusion bodies also 
      contain the small heat-shock protein (HSP) alphaB-crystallin but not HSP70. To study 
      the molecular mechanisms underlying inclusion body formation, we engineered an 
      oligodendroglia cell line (OLN-t40) to overexpress the longest human tau isoform. 
      Treatment of OLN-t40 cells with okadaic acid (OA), an inhibitor of protein 
      phosphatase 2A, caused tau hyperphosphorylation and a decrease in the binding of tau 
      to microtubules. Simultaneously, tau-positive aggregates that also stained with the 
      amyloid-binding dye thioflavin-S as well as with antibodies to tau and 
      alphaB-crystallin were detected. However, they were only transiently expressed and 
      were degraded within 24 hr. When the proteasomal apparatus was inhibited by 
      carbobenzoxy-l-leucyl-l-leucyl-l-leucinal (MG-132) after OA treatment, the 
      aggregates were stabilized and were still detectable after 18 hr in the absence of 
      OA. Incubation with MG-132 alone inhibited tau proteolysis and led to the induction 
      of HSPs, including alphaB-crystallin and to its translocation to the perinuclear 
      region, but did not induce the formation of thioflavin-S-positive aggregates. Hence, 
      although tau hyperphosphorylation induced by protein phosphatase inhibition 
      contributes to pathological aggregate formation, only hyperphosporylation of tau 
      followed by proteasome inhibition leads to stable fibrillary deposits of tau similar 
      to those observed in neurodegenerative diseases.

AB  - Magnetic Resonance (MR) white matter hyperintensities have been shown to predict an 
      increased risk of developing cognitive decline. However, their actual role in the 
      conversion to dementia is still not fully understood. Automatic segmentation methods 
      can help in the screening and monitoring of Mild Cognitive Impairment patients who 
      take part in large population-based studies. Most existing segmentation approaches 
      use multimodal MR images. However, multiple acquisitions represent a limitation in 
      terms of both patient comfort and computational complexity of the algorithms. In 
      this work, we propose an automatic lesion segmentation method that uses only 
      three-dimensional fluid-attenuation inversion recovery (FLAIR) images. We use a 
      modified context-sensitive Gaussian mixture model to determine voxel class 
      probabilities, followed by correction of FLAIR artifacts. We evaluate the method 
      against the manual segmentation performed by an experienced neuroradiologist and 
      compare the results with other unimodal segmentation approaches. Finally, we apply 
      our method to the segmentation of multiple sclerosis lesions by using a publicly 
      available benchmark dataset. Results show a similar performance to other 
      state-of-the-art multimodal methods, as well as to the human rater.

TI  - Clinicopathological description of two cases with SQSTM1 gene mutation associated 
      with frontotemporal dementia.
PG  - 27-38
LID - 10.1111/neup.12233 [doi]
AB  - There is a strong genetic influence on the clinicopathological phenotypes associated 
      with frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). 
      Intracellular deposition of TDP-43 is the phenotypical hallmark of a frequent 
      subgroup of cases. Mutations in the sequestosome 1 (SQSTM1) gene have rarely been 
      found in individuals with FTD. Here we provide a comprehensive clinicopathological 
      description of two cases with a SQSTM1 mutation. The clinical phenotype of patient 1 
      (mutation p.Glu396*) was compatible with the behavioural variant (bv) of FTD. TDP-43 
      pathology was consistent with the features of type B of FTLD-TDP pathology. However, 
      prominent neuronal granular cytoplasmic TDP-43 immunoreactivity and abundant 
      oligodendroglial inclusions, proven by colocalization with the 
      oligodendroglial-marker TPPP/p25, were also seen. The clinical phenotype of patient 
      2 was compatible with bvFTD associated with parkinsonism and bulbar symptoms in the 
      later stage. Genetic testing of patient 2 identified a C9orf72 repeat expansion 
      mutation together with a missense mutation (p.Arg212Cys) in SQSTM1. TDP-43 pathology 
      was characterized by neuritic profiles compatible mostly with type A. In contrast to 
      patient 1, p62 pathology was seen to a greater extent as TDP-43 immunoreactivity in 
      neurons. Using an antibody that detects poly(GP) peptides produced via repeat 
      associated non-ATG translation associated with expanded hexanucleotide repeat in the 
      C9orf72 gene, we confirmed the presence of pathognomonic inclusions. The present 
      study supports previous observations on amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) that 
      SQSTM1 mutations consistently associate with TDP-43 pathology. The co-presence of 
      C9orf72 mutation may influence the phenotype, thus finding one FTLD (or ALS) related 
      mutation does not exclude the presence of further influential genetic alterations. 
      Oligodendroglial TDP-43 pathology is considerable in some forms of FTLD-TDP, thus 
      their evaluation might be considered to be included in classification systems.

TI  - Hypomyelinating leukoencephalopathy with paroxysmal tonic upgaze and absence of 
      psychomotor development.
PG  - 226-30
AB  - Hypomyelinating leukoencephalopathies are characterized by a substantial and 
      permanent deficit in myelin deposition in the brain. Although our knowledge and 
      understanding of the etiology of white matter diseases has progressively increased, 
      many cases with this disorder remain undiagnosed, despite extensive evaluations. 
      Recently, new disease entities have been defined by combining magnetic resonance 
      imaging pattern recognition and clinical features. We describe a 1-year-old 
      Ashkenazi Jewish girl with a hypomyelinating leukoencephalopathy, who presented in 
      the neonatal period with episodes of sustained paroxysmal tonic upward gaze, roving 
      eye movements, pendular nystagmus, and severe hypotonia, with the later appearance 
      of pyramidal and extrapyramidal signs and no development. In addition, she has 
      dysmorphic signs. This clinical picture is not consistent with any of the previously 
      described hypomyelinating leukoencephalopathies and may represent a new entity.

TI  - Loss of white matter oligodendrocytes and astrocytes in progressive subcortical 
      vascular encephalopathy of Binswanger type.
PG  - 301-5
AB  - To study whether oligodendrocytes and astrocytes can be affected in progressive 
      subcortical vascular encephalopathy of Binswanger type (PSVE), the number of 
      oligodendrocytes and astrocytes was counted in the white matter of frontal lobe. A 
      sum of the number of oligodendrocytes and astrocytes in the deep white matter in 
      PSVE accounted for approximately half of that in the age-matched controls. The 
      number of oligodendrocytes, which were defined as the cells with small, round and 
      solid nuclei in the present study, also decreased in PSVE showing half of that in 
      the deep white matter of the controls. The present data suggest that the loss of 
      oligodendrocytes and astrocytes can play a role to the process of nerve fibres loss 
      in PSVE, which has been reported in my previous study (1), although the possibility 
      that nerve fibres loss results in the secondary loss of oligodendrocytes can not be 
      ruled out.

TI  - Familial multiple-system tauopathy with presenile dementia is localized to 
      chromosome 17.
PG  - 1131-8
AB  - An autosomal dominant presenile dementia affecting 39 individuals in a 
      seven-generation, 383-member pedigree has been studied at Indiana University. In the 
      affected members of this family, clinical symptoms occurred early in life, with an 
      average age at onset of 48.8 years. The presenting clinical features include 
      disequilibrium, neck stiffness, dysphagia, and memory loss. As the disease 
      progresses, further cognitive decline, superior-gaze palsy, and dystaxia also are 
      observed. The average duration from onset of symptoms to death is approximately 10 
      years. Neuropathologic studies of nine affected individuals showed neuronal loss in 
      several areas of the CNS, as well as argentophilic tau-immunopositive inclusions in 
      neurons and in oligodendroglia. A limited genomic screen by use of DNA samples from 
      28 family members localized the gene for this disorder to a 3-cM region on 
      chromosome 17, between the markers THRA1 and D17S791. The gene for tau also was 
      analyzed, through samples from the family.

TI  - The significance of anti-neuronal antibodies in Alzheimer's disease.
PG  - 107-16
AB  - Indirect immunofluorescence and cell-type-specific markers were used to determine 
      whether antibodies directed against specific neural cell types were present in 
      patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), other neurological diseases (OND) and normal 
      controls. Sera and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were tested on either frozen sections 
      of rat and human cortex and/or dissociated cell cultures of neonatal rat cerebellum, 
      and human fetal dorsal root ganglia (DRG). All groups of patients and normal 
      subjects were indistinguishable in their pattern of immunoglobulin (Ig) staining. 
      Staining of neurones on frozen sections was predominantly nuclear. In cultures all 
      sera showed weak staining of oligodendrocytes, fibroblasts and Schwann cells. 
      Varying degrees of surface staining of neurones were seen with both sera and CSF 
      within all groups.

TI  - Amygdala cell loss and atrophy in Alzheimer's disease.
PG  - 555-63
AB  - The amygdala and its subnuclei undergo severe volumetric atrophy in Alzheimer's 
      disease (AD). To determine whether this atrophy is due to loss of neuropil, specific 
      neuronal populations, or both, we evaluated the number, size, and packing density of 
      neurons and glia in the cortical and magnocellular basal amygdaloid subregions. The 
      neuropil fraction did not change with AD in either region. Despite a mean 35% 
      increase in cell packing density in the AD amygdala, total numbers of neurons and 
      glia within tissue sections were reduced significantly; medium and large neurons 
      were preferentially affected. The total number of small neurons was stable in the AD 
      sample despite sharp reductions in nuclear size, suggesting that AD also results in 
      pronounced amygdaloid neuronal shrinkage. Differences in the degree of cell loss 
      between the two nuclei as well as changes in glial cell numbers are discussed in 
      relation to characteristic AD neuropathology and relevant anatomical connectivity.

TI  - [Early cerebral lesions in HIV infection. Postmortem radio-pathologic correlations 
      in non-AIDS asymptomatic seropositive patients].
PG  - 148-60
AB  - In order to evaluate the diagnostic and prognostic value of MRI in the very early 
      stages of HIV infection, we have compared the results of postmortem brain MRI and 
      neuropathological studies in 7 asymptomatic HIV seropositive individuals, 8 
      seronegative controls with similar cause of death and 6 patients who died of AIDS in 
      the absence of focal cerebral changes (opportunistic infection or tumour). Cerebral 
      atrophy was consistently evaluated by both techniques. Seropositive asymptomatic 
      cases were significantly more atrophic than the seronegative controls and 
      significantly less atrophic than AIDS patients. Small high signal intensity areas in 
      the white matter and basal ganglia were not significantly more frequent in 
      seropositives than in seronegatives. No corresponding lesion was found at 
      neuropathological examination. Diffuse myelin pallor of the cerebral white matter on 
      myelin preparation was somewhat more severe in seropositive asymptomatic cases than 
      in seronegative controls and less than in AIDS cases. However, these differences 
      were not statistically significant. No significant correlation could be found 
      between neuropathological myelin pallor and diffuse signal abnormalities of the 
      white matter on MRI. We conclude that brain abnormalities are present at the early 
      asymptomatic stage of HIV infection. These include vasculitis with opening of the 
      blood brain barrier and consequent myelin pallor and gliosis of the white matter, 
      and moderate brain atrophy. However MRI correlates are discrete or non specific on 
      post mortem examination, and some probably correspond to scars of transient vascular 
      inflammation. It is very unlikely that MRI examination has any diagnostic or 
      prognostic value at the early stages of the disease.

AB  - Fragile X tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) occurs in individuals with moderate CGG 
      expansion of the fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene and is associated with 
      intranuclear inclusions in neurons and astrocytes. Although the neuropathologic 
      findings in the brain and spinal cord were described, pathological features in the 
      peripheral nervous system were not reported. Here, we report on novel 
      neuropathological findings in the peripheral nervous system and especially in 
      autonomic ganglia at autopsy in a man with FXTAS. In addition to the characteristic 
      brain and spinal cord findings, typical intranuclear inclusions were identified in 
      the ganglion cells of adrenal medulla, dorsal root ganglia, paraspinal sympathetic 
      ganglia, myenteric ganglia of the stomach and subepicardial autonomic ganglion of 
      the heart. Our findings indicate that FXTAS diffusely involves the central and 
      peripheral nervous systems, which explains the protean neurological symptoms ranging 
      from dementia to dysautonomia.

TI  - Perineuronal satellitosis in the human hippocampal formation.
PG  - 239-50
AB  - A previously unreported example of perineuronal satellitosis in the medial CA1 and 
      adjacent subiculum in the human hippocampal formation is described. This phenomenon 
      is characterized by a clustering of glial cells in relation to the perikarya of a 
      subpopulation of neurons in the deep pyramidal layer and around most neurons 
      scattered in the stratum oriens and subcortical white matter. Most of the 
      perineuronal satellite glia were identified as oligodendrocytes based on their 
      nuclear chromatin patterns and antigenic properties. Satellite oligodendrocytes were 
      mostly of the medium dense variety. A type of satellite glia with nuclear features 
      of the dark oligodendrocyte could not be identified unequivocally using the 
      antigenic criteria employed in this study.

TI  - Comparison of postmortem magnetic resonance imaging and neuropathologic findings in 
      the cerebral white matter.
PG  - 293-8
AB  - Two types of high-signal intensity abnormalities are frequently found bilaterally in 
      the cerebral white matter of brains of elderly patients on T2-weighted magnetic 
      resonance imaging (MRI) scans. One is located in the immediate periventricular 
      region; the other, in the deep subcortical white matter (centrum semiovale). The 
      diagnostic implications of this second type continue to be uncertain. To determine 
      the neuropathologic correlates of these lesions, the brains from seven elderly 
      patients were fixed in buffered formaldehyde solution, subjected to MRI scanning, 
      and examined neuropathologically. Variable degrees of bilateral periventricular 
      (subependymal) sharply defined areas of high-signal intensity were found in all the 
      brains, and the larger of these showed corresponding areas of myelin pallor with 
      gliosis and dilated perivascular spaces. Discrete bilateral patches of high-signal 
      intensity were found in the centrum semiovale in five patients. Myelin and axon 
      stains showed varying degrees of diffuse white matter pallor in many areas examined, 
      both with and without these areas of high-signal intensity on MRI scans. Neither the 
      myelin nor the axon stains showed discrete white matter abnormalities that 
      corresponded to the MRI findings. We believe that these changes, so commonly found 
      on MRI scans in the elderly, reflect actual changes in the white matter but that 
      their nature and clinical significance need to be elucidated.

TI  - SP-40,40 immunoreactivity in inflammatory CNS lesions displaying 
      astrocyte/oligodendrocyte interactions.
PG  - 129-34
AB  - Immunoreactivity for SP-40,40, a putative complement inhibitor, adhesion or 
      protective molecule, has been examined in a variety of inflammatory CNS lesions that 
      displayed associations between hypertrophic astrocytes and oligodendrocytes, a 
      phenomenon previously suggested to be related to oligodendrocyte phagocytosis or 
      protection. SP-40,40 staining was common and was predominantly limited to 
      hypertrophic astrocytes within lesion areas and diminished beyond the lesion margin. 
      However, there was no consistent relationship between SP-40,40 immunoreactivity and 
      astrocytes associated with oligodendrocytes. Staining for terminal complement 
      complex (C5b-9/SC5b-9) occurred in association with larger vessel walls and 
      microglial cells in the most active lesions, but was never seen in hypertrophic 
      astrocytes. No association between SP-40,40 and complement deposition could be 
      demonstrated. Staining for tumor necrosis factor-alpha showed a few scattered 
      hypertrophic astrocytes to be positive. The findings confirm the presence of these 
      astrocyte/oligodendrocyte interactions in active CNS lesions of varied etiology 
      (multiple sclerosis, stroke and AIDS encephalitis). SP-40,40 immunoreactivity was 
      common to hypertrophic astrocytes regardless of their associations with 
      oligodendrocytes but showed no colocalization with terminal complement complex. 
      Thus, these glial interactions do not apparently involve protection against 
      complement-mediated lysis. Furthermore, the presence of SP-40,40 in astrocytes 
      lacking association with oligodendrocytes did not support a role for this protein 
      functioning as an adhesion molecule in astrocyte/oligodendrocyte associations.

TI  - Morphometric analysis of the prefrontal cortex in Huntington's disease.
PG  - 1117-23
AB  - We performed a morphometric analysis of cresyl violet-stained sections from the 
      dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of 81 patients with Huntington's disease (HD) (grades 
      2, 3, and 4) and 23 age-matched normal controls. We counted large pyramidal neurons, 
      small neurons, astrocytes, oligodendroglia, and microglia under the guidance of a 
      specifically predefined set of morphologic criteria for each cell type and recorded 
      the thickness of each cortical layer. Our results demonstrate a selective and 
      progressive loss of a subset of the large pyramidal neurons in cortical layers III, 
      V, and VI of HD patients, and a decrease in the thickness of the respective cortical 
      laminae. A genetically determined, cell-autonomous degeneration of cortical neurons 
      could constitute the primary pathologic process. However, the loss of only a 
      fraction of pyramidal cells suggest a parallel, or an alternative, possibility of a 
      retrograde degeneration of cortical neurons that project solely, or principally, to 
      the site of primary degeneration in caudate nuclei.

TI  - Characterization of myelin pathology in the hippocampal complex of a transgenic 
      mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.
PG  - 30-7
AB  - We have characterized the myelin changes observed within the hippocampal complex 
      (HC) of a transgenic (Tg) mouse model of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Individual 
      myelinated fibers were labeled with Black-Gold II while amyloid plaques were labeled 
      with either Congo Red or Pan-A-beta immunofluoresence. Myelinated fibers were never 
      seen passing through amyloid plaques in any region, while conspicuous myelin 
      pathology was seen within, and immediately adjacent to, the amyloid plaques in the 
      HC of the AD-Tg mouse. This pathology consisted of a complete disruption of 
      myelinated fibers passing through the plaque and the region immediately adjacent to 
      the plaques exhibited an edematous swelling of the fibers. This pathology was most 
      frequently observed within the molecular and polymorph layers of the dentate gyrus 
      and the molecular layer of Ammon's horn. The remaining layers of Ammon's horn 
      exhibited minimal myelin pathology, while moderate myelinopathy was observed in the 
      subiculum. Since the HC is integral for memory function, these findings may help 
      account for the memory problems so characteristic of the disease process. Because 
      the molecular layers of the dentate gyrus and Ammon's horn are the sites of inputs 
      to the HC, the extensive myelin pathology observed in these regions would imply 
      functional deafferentation of the HC. The appearance of some Black-Gold II positive 
      debris within the plaques may reflect a possible cascade mechanism whereby the 
      presence of plaques results in myelin degeneration, some of which is incorporated 
      within the plaque, causing it to further expand in a self-perpetuating fashion.

TI  - Serum amyloid A in Alzheimer's disease brain is predominantly localized to myelin

PG  - 105-10
AB  - Immunohistochemical localization of the injury specific apolipoprotein, acute phase 
      serum amyloid A (A-apoSAA), was compared in brains of patients with 
      neuropathologically confirmed Alzheimer's disease (AD), multiple sclerosis (MS), 
      Parkinson's disease (PD); Pick's disease (Pick's), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), 
      coronary artery disease (CAD), and schizophrenia. Affected regions of both AD and MS 
      brains showed intense staining for A-apoSAA in comparison to an unaffected region 
      and non-AD/MS brains. The major site of A-apoSAA staining in both diseases was the 
      myelin sheaths of axons in layers V and VI of affected cortex. A-apoSAA contains a 
      cholesterol binding site near its amino terminus and is likely to have a high 
      affinity for cholesterol-rich myelin. These findings, along with our recent evidence 
      that A-apoSAA can inhibit lipid synthesis in vascular smooth muscle cells suggest 
      that A-apoSAA plays a role in the neuronal loss and white matter damage occurring in 
      AD and MS.

TI  - Stem cell strategies for neuroreplacement therapy in Alzheimer's disease.
PG  - 697-700
AB  - The existence of neural stem cells (NSCs) in the adult human brain provides impetus 
      for investigating possible neuroreplacement therapies for neurodegenerative disease. 
      Due to recent advances in techniques affording isolation and maintenance of NSCs 
      using non-serum culture media, these cells have become exciting candidates for 
      therapeutic strategies. We are able to expand NSCs by mitogenic growth factors in 
      vitro and in defined conditions, NSCs differentiate into each of the diverse brain 
      cell types: neurons, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. This article addresses the 
      involvement of amyloid-beta precursor protein and the presenilins in NSCs' biology 
      and possible application of NSCs for therapeutic approaches in Alzheimer's disease. 
      Ongoing studies in our laboratory, and recent findings by others using human neural 
      progenitors, serve as the conceptual frame for this article.

TI  - Neurological disease and herpes simplex virus. An immunohistochemical study.
PG  - 24-8
AB  - The brains of 43 patients, some with various neurological disorders, other controls, 
      were examined for herpes simplex virus (HSV) antigen using immunoperoxidase 
      technique. The three patients with herpes simplex encephalitis shared a pattern of 
      staining, consistent with that reported previously. However, of the other 40 
      patients, only two (one a patient with Alzheimer's disease, the other a control 
      patient) showed areas of brain positive for HSV antigen (VA). In the patient with 
      Alzheimer's disease VA was present within nerve and glial cells of the amygdala, 
      within oligodendrocytes of the optic and olfactory tracts and in macrophages within 
      the temporal cortex hippocampus and cerebellum. In the control patient VA was seen 
      only in oligodendrocytes of optic chiasma and olfactory tract. The scarcity of these 
      findings suggests "coincidental disease" processes within these two patients and 
      means that any hypothesis implicating HSV as an aetiological agent in degenerative 
      disease must still remain extremely speculative.

TI  - Heightened expression of tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin 1 alpha, and glial 
      fibrillary acidic protein in experimental Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in mice.
PG  - 9754-8
AB  - The ultrastructural pathology of myelinated axons in mice infected experimentally 
      with the Fujisaki strain of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) virus is characterized 
      by myelin sheath vacuolation that closely resembles that induced in murine spinal 
      cord organotypic cultures by tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), a cytokine 
      produced by astrocytes and macrophages. To clarify the role of TNF-alpha in 
      experimental CJD, we investigated the expression of TNF-alpha in brain tissues from 
      CJD virus-infected mice at weekly intervals after inoculation by reverse 
      transcription-coupled PCR, Northern and Western blot analyses, and 
      immunocytochemical staining. Neuropathological findings by electron microscopy, as 
      well as expression of interleukin 1 alpha and glial fibrillary acidic protein, were 
      concurrently monitored. As determined by reverse transcription-coupled PCR, the 
      expression of TNF-alpha, interleukin 1 alpha, and glial fibrillary acidic protein 
      was increased by approximately 200-fold in the brains of CJD virus-inoculated mice 
      during the course of disease. By contrast, beta-actin expression remained unchanged. 
      Progressively increased expression of TNF-alpha in CJD virus-infected brain tissues 
      was verified by Northern and Western blot analyses, and astrocytes in areas with 
      striking myelin sheath vacuolation were intensely stained with an antibody against 
      murine TNF-alpha. The collective findings of TNF-alpha overexpression during the 
      course of clinical disease suggest that TNF-alpha may mediate the myelin sheath 
      vacuolation observed in experimental CJD.

TI  - Interrelationship between beta-amyloid deposition and complement-activated 
      oligodendroglia.
PG  - 267-72
AB  - Complement-activated oligodendroglia (CAOs) are thought to represent complement 
      bearing damaged oligodendroglia for opsonization. The interrelationship between CAOs 
      and amyloid deposits was examined by immunohistochemistry in the parietal lobe of 
      patients with Parkinson's disease, diffuse Lewy body disease, and 
      pallido-nigro-luysial atrophy. In all brains, the anti-C4d antibody stained numerous 
      CAOs. Anti-beta-amyloid protein (anti-A beta) antibody revealed moderate numbers of 
      senile plaques, including some of the classical type. In both the grey and the white 
      matter amyloid deposits were frequently associated with the myelinated axons of 
      CAOs. CAOs were occasionally associated with phagocytosing microglial cells. 
      Immunoelectron microscopy also showed a close relationship between phagocytosing 
      microglia and A beta deposition. On some occasions. A beta deposits were seen in 
      C4d-positive oligodendroglial cell bodies. These results indicate that damaged 
      myelinated axons, which contain accumulated amyloid precursor protein, are the 
      source of A beta, and that CAOs may be initial targets for A beta deposits forming 
      the classical senile plaques.

TI  - Experimental transmission of human subacute spongiform encephalopathy to small 
      rodents. II. Ultrastructural study of spongy state in the gray and white matter.
PG  - 135-40
AB  - Light and electron microscopic findings of spongy state in four species of small 
      rodents, viz, mice, rats, Mongolian gerbils, and guinea pigs, are described. The 
      spongy state existed in both gray and white matter; its intensity varied in each 
      species, and in the gray matter corresponded to vacuoles within the neuropil. They 
      were of two types; one was the true vacuoles within neurites, and the other was 
      markedly swollen cell processes, some of which were also identified as neurites. In 
      the white matter, the spongy state corresponded mainly to distension of the myelin 
      sheaths, due to splitting of the major dense line or swelling of the inner loop, and 
      partly to intra-axonal vacuoles. In mice before appearance of clinical symptoms, the 
      vacuolation occurred first in the cerebral white matter 5 weeks after inoculation 
      and in the cerebral cortex at 7 weeks. The occurrence and development of the 
      vacuoles are discussed.

TI  - Echigo-1: a panencephalopathic strain of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease: ultrastructural 
      studies of the optic nerve.
PG  - 281-2
AB  - The Echigo-1 strain of CJD was isolated by Mori and colleagues (1989) from a case of 
      33-year-old female with a panencephalopathic type of CJD. An incubation period 
      following intracerebral inoculation of hamsters with 10% cleared suspension of the 
      Echigo-1-affected brain was approximately six months. We report here ultrastructural 
      changes which are comparable with those in the white matter of another 
      panencephalopathic type of CJD, the Fujisaki strain of CJD (GSS) passaged in mice. 
      Vacuoles developed within myelinated axons: within axoplasm or within the myelin 
      sheath and these were accompanied by exuberant reaction of macrophages and 
      hypertrophic astrocytes. Axons underwent Wallerian degeneration and dystrophic 
      neurites were also seen. Most important, we observed proliferation of inner 
      mesaxons. Cross-sectional profiles of innumerable myelinated fibers contained 
      membranous organelles which were continuous with the inner lamellae of the 
      oligodendroglial cells. These unusual proliferations of inner mesaxon formed whorls 
      and elaborated loops. In some axons, proliferation was so severe that loops of 
      mesaxon filled the whole cross-section of the axon. Occasionally, we observed 
      intrusion of the membranous tongue of the inner mesaxon into axoplasm. This study 
      presents a second panencephalopathic model of CJD available in small laboratory 
      rodents. It is important because this is the only such model in hamsters and it may 
      be used for comparative studies of different strains of agent in the same host; thus 
      far only mouse and hamster model have been available for comparative studies.

PG  - 382-7
AB  - To study white matter changes in the frontal lobes and to investigate the 
      histopathological basis for the dementia in progressive subcortical vascular 
      encephalopathy (PSVE), the frontal white matter was examined by electron microscopy 
      in seven cases with PSVE, and compared with that in a control group and in cases 
      with senile dementia of Alzheimer's type (SDAT). The number of nerve fibres per unit 
      selected area of the white matter was significantly less in PSVE compared with that 
      in the control group or in SDAT. Nerve fibres in PSVE had a tendency to have thinner 
      myelin sheaths than in the control group or in SDAT, but the difference was not 
      significant. The pallor of the frontal white matter in PSVE is mainly based on the 
      loss of nerve fibres, and may be in part based on the thin myelin sheaths. The 
      dementia in PSVE is probably related to the loss of nerve fibres in the cerebral 
      white matter.

LID - 10.1016/j.jneumeth.2011.04.022 [doi]
AB  - Cortical thinning and intracortical gray matter volume losses are widely observed in 
      normal ageing, while the decreasing rate of the volume loss in subjects with 
      neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease is reported to be faster 
      than the average speed. Therefore, neurodegenerative disease is considered as 
      accelerated ageing. Accurate detection of accelerated ageing based on the magnetic 
      resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain is a relatively new direction of research in 
      computational neuroscience as it has the potential to offer positive clinical 
      outcome through early intervention. In order to capture the faster structural 
      alterations in the brain with ageing, we propose in this paper a computational 
      approach for modelling the MRI-based structure of the brain using the framework of 
      hidden Markov models, which can be utilized for age prediction. Experiments were 
      carried out on healthy subjects to validate its accuracy and its robustness. The 
      results have shown its ability of predicting the brain age with an average 
      normalized age-gap error of two to three years, which is superior to several 
      recently developed methods for brain age prediction.

AB  - Multiple system atrophy is a sporadic, adult-onset neurodegenerative disease of 
      unknown etiology. The condition may be unique among neurodegenerative diseases by 
      the prominent, if not primary, role played by the oligodendroglial cell in the 
      pathogenetic process. Recent developments in our understanding of multiple system 
      atrophy have included the detection of glial cytoplasmic inclusions and 
      alpha-synuclein accumulation in these inclusions. The latter finding links multiple 
      system atrophy as an "alpha-synucleinopathy" to Parkinson's disease and dementia 
      with Lewy bodies. This article reviews recent important findings of potential 
      relevance to the pathogenesis of multiple system atrophy. We also speculate on areas 
      in which further advances may be made to progress our understanding of this 
      devastating condition.

TI  - In situ analysis of neostriatal RNA and chromatin in Alzheimer's disease.
PG  - 309-13
AB  - Scanning-integrating microdensitometry of azure B-RNA- and Feulgen-Schiff-stained 
      tissue sections was used to measure neostriatal neuronal RNA levels and 
      susceptibility of neuronal and oligodendrocyte chromatin to acid hydrolysis in 
      Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients and controls. AD was associated with neuronal RNA 
      depletion (17 to 23%) in both caudate nucleus and putamen. While neuronal chromatin 
      was found to be more acid-labile than that of the oligodendrocytes, there were no 
      differences in either cell type between AD and controls. These data support the 
      existence of a macromolecular disturbance (RNA loss) occurring within neostriatal 
      neurons, perhaps related to the extrapyramidal dysfunction of AD, but fail to 
      demonstrate that an alteration in chromatin is responsible for this effect.

TI  - Convergence of heat shock protein 90 with ubiquitin in filamentous alpha-synuclein 
      inclusions of alpha-synucleinopathies.
PG  - 947-61
AB  - Heat shock proteins (Hsps) facilitate refolding of denatured polypeptides, but there 
      is limited understanding about their roles in neurodegenerative diseases 
      characterized by misfolded proteins. Because Parkinson's disease (PD), dementia with 
      Lewy bodies, and multiple system atrophy are alpha-synucleinopathies characterized 
      by filamentous alpha-synuclein (alpha-syn) inclusions, we assessed which Hsps might 
      be implicated in these disorders by examining human brain samples, transgenic mouse 
      models, and cell culture systems. Light and electron microscopic multiple-label 
      immunohistochemistry showed Hsp90 was the predominant Hsp examined that co-localized 
      with alpha-syn in Lewy bodies, Lewy neurites, and glial cell inclusions and that 
      Hsp90 co-localized with alpha-syn filaments of Lewy bodies in PD. Hsp90 levels were 
      most predominantly increased in PD brains, which correlated with increased levels of 
      insoluble alpha-syn. These alterations in Hsp90 were recapitulated in a transgenic 
      mouse model of PD-like alpha-syn pathologies. Cell culture studies also revealed 
      that alpha-syn co-immunoprecipitated preferentially with Hsp90 and Hsc70 relative to 
      other Hsps, and exposure of cells to proteasome inhibitors resulted in increased 
      levels of Hsp90. These data implicate predominantly Hsp90 in the formation of 
      alpha-syn inclusions in PD and related alpha-synucleinopathies.

TI  - Nerve cell loss in the thalamic mediodorsal nucleus in Huntington's disease.
PG  - 613-22
AB  - We estimated the total neurone number, glial number, and glial index (ratio glial 
      cells/neurone) in the thalamic mediodorsal nucleus (MD) in seven patients suffering 
      from Huntington's disease (HD; four males, three females, mean age 52.4 +/- 13.6 
      years) and age- and sex-matched controls (four males, three females, mean age 53.6 
      +/- 12.1 years) by means of a stereological protocol. The mean total neurone number 
      (N(T)) in the MD of controls was 2,985,188 +/- 174,710, the mean glial number (G(T); 
      astrocytes, oligodendrocytes) 21,785,008 +/- 2,986,678, and the glial index 7.29 +/- 
      0.88. In HD, the average neurone number was decreased by 23.8% to 2,275,321 +/- 
      247,162 (Mann-Whitney U-test P < 0.05), the mean glial number by 29.7% to 15,318,895 
      +/- 1,722,524 (Mann-Whitney U-test P < 0.05), the glial index was slightly reduced 
      to 6.81 +/- 1.06. Gallyas' impregnation for the demonstration of fibrous astroglia 
      gave strongly positive results in all cases with HD and negative results in the 
      controls. The morpho-functional correlation of the results is complicated because 
      individual variability, presence of segregated and parallel neuronal circuits, and 
      plasticity of the adult human CNS must be considered.

PG  - 343-6
AB  - A brother and sister developed a slowly progressive neurological disorder with 
      cerebellar and pyramidal signs and mild dementia. The brother developed symptoms at 
      6 months and died aged 11 years; the sister developed symptoms at 3 years and died 
      aged 18 years. At post-mortem both had severe widespread central nervous system 
      demyelination with islands of preserved myelin, and small amounts of sudanophilic 
      lipid products. Metachromatic material, globoid cells, and adrenal abnormalities 
      were not seen. The features were those of Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease (PMD). It has 
      been proposed, on the basis of only a few family studies, that PMD is an X-linked 
      recessive disorder. These cases suggest that autosomal recessive inheritance may 
      occur.

TI  - Intrathecal synthesis of anti-myelin basic protein IgG in HIV-1+ patients.
PG  - 285-92
AB  - Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-infected individuals frequently develop 
      a broad spectrum of neurological syndromes, classified as HIV-1-associated 
      cognitive/motor complex. Diffuse demyelination of hemispheric white matter is a 
      commonly observed in HIV-1 infected brain, but the events leading to myelin 
      destruction are still obscure. Since oligodendrocyte infection by HIV-1 is not 
      proven as yet, myelin damage in HIV-1 infection may result from indirect mechanisms 
      such as the excessive release of myelinotoxic substances or the triggering of 
      autoimmune responses directed to myelin constituents. To verify the latter 
      hypothesis, we searched for elevated anti-myelin basic protein (MBP) IgG levels in 
      the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum of 25 patients with HIV-1 infection, 12 with 
      multiple sclerosis (MS), and 9 with non-inflammatory neurological diseases (NIND). 
      CSF, but not serum, anti-MBP IgG levels were more frequently elevated in HIV-1+ 
      (16/25, 64%) than in MS (3/12, 25%) or NIND (0/9) patients. By using the anti-MBP 
      IgG index, the anti-MBP IgG antibody specificity index (ASI), and the search for 
      anti-MBP oligoclonal IgG, we ascertained that anti-MBP IgG were produced within the 
      CNS in 13 of 25 (52%) HIV-1+, in 6 of 12 (50%) MS, and in none of NIND patients. The 
      incidence of increased CSF anti-MBP IgG levels was higher among HIV-1+ patients at 
      stage II-III (4/4, 100%) or at stage IV B (7/9, 78%) than among those at stage IV 
      C-IV D (5/12, 42%). Although our data indicate that intrathecal anti-MBP IgG may 
      occur early during HIV-1 infection and that they are more common in patients with 
      HIV-1-associated cognitive/motor complex, the possible demyelinating role of these 
      antibodies remains to be demonstrated.

TI  - Membrane lipids, selectively diminished in Alzheimer brains, suggest synapse loss as 
      a primary event in early-onset form (type I) and demyelination in late-onset form 
      (type II).
PG  - 1039-47
AB  - Major membrane lipids were quantified in frontal (Brodmann area 9) and temporal 
      (Brodmann areas 21 and 22) cortices, caudate nucleus, hippocampus, and frontal white 
      matter of 12 cases with Alzheimer's disease (AD) type I (early onset), 21 cases with 
      AD type II (late onset), and 20 age-matched controls. The concentration of 
      gangliosides--a marker for axodendritic arborization--was reduced to 58-70% of the 
      control concentration in all four gray areas (p < 0.0001) and to 81% in frontal 
      white matter (p < 0.01) of AD type I cases, whereas it was only significantly 
      reduced in temporal cortex (p < 0.01), hippocampus (p < 0.05), and frontal white 
      matter (p < 0.05) in AD type II cases. The concentration of phospholipids was also 
      significantly reduced (p < 0.01-0.0001) in all four gray areas of AD type I cases 
      but in no area of AD type II cases. The loss of cholesterol was only 50% of the 
      corresponding phospholipid diminution in AD type I. These results suggested a 
      pronounced loss of nerve endings in AD type I. The characteristic membrane lipid 
      disturbance in AD type II was a loss of myelin lipids. This is the first time a 
      fundamental biochemical difference has been shown between the two major forms of AD.

TI  - Neurochemical changes in white matter. Aged human brain and Alzheimer's disease.
PG  - 1063-6
AB  - We report a reduction in isolatable myelin in white matter from regional areas of 
      aged human brain. This decrease was most prominent in association subcortex of 
      Alzheimer's material. We also found structural changes in myelin lipids. These 
      changes involved an increase in unsaturated acyl chains and suggest an age-related 
      instability of subcortical white matter. This specific chemical change in myelin 
      glycosphingolipids has been found in all regional areas of normal aged and 
      Alzheimer's brain material. This remains an age-related molecular change that seems 
      unrelated to the pathophysiology of senile dementia of the Alzheimer's type.

TI  - Decreased neuronal and increased oligodendroglial densities in Huntington's disease 
      caudate nucleus.
PG  - 729-42
AB  - Decreased density of neurons was found throughout the head of the caudate nucleus in 
      Huntington's disease (HD), with the most severe neuronal loss early in the disease 
      in the medial region. The density of reactive astrocytes is inversely proportional 
      to the neuronal loss. In cases of mild Huntington's disease which had no 
      identifiable abnormality on conventional neuropathologic evaluation (grade 0), there 
      is a reduction in neuron density without an accompanying reactive astrocytosis. The 
      pattern for decrease in neurons and accompanying astrocytosis suggests that the 
      earliest changes occur in the most medial portion of the head of the caudate nucleus 
      and subsequently sweep laterally across the caudate nucleus to the internal capsule. 
      An increased density of oligodendrocytes is observed in the head of the caudate 
      nucleus for the lower grades (0, 1 and 2). The decreased neuronal and increased 
      oligodendroglial densities may be of significance in understanding the pathogenesis 
      of HD. These altered densities, observed in the absence of reactive astrocytosis, 
      suggest that these changes may not represent recent effects of disease, but rather 
      that HD gene expression may influence brain cell densities from early in the life of 
      the gene carrier.

TI  - TDP-43-positive white matter pathology in frontotemporal lobar degeneration with 
      ubiquitin-positive inclusions.
PG  - 177-83
AB  - TDP-43 was recently identified as the major disease protein in neuronal inclusions 
      in frontotemporal lobar degeneration with ubiquitin-positive inclusions (FTLD-U). 
      TDP-43 is not only linked to disease mechanisms in FTLD-U, but it is also the most 
      robust marker for the specific detection of neuronal inclusions in FTLD-U. In this 
      study, we describe additional TDP-43 pathology in the white matter as a 
      characteristic feature in a series of 38 FTLD-U cases including 3 cases with 
      mutations in the progranulin gene. White matter pathology was most abundant in 
      frontal and temporal lobes, but it was also detectable in brainstem and spinal cord. 
      Based on morphology and double-labeling experiments, white matter cells with 
      TDP-43-positive inclusions most likely represent oligodendrocytes. Biochemically, 
      hyperphosphorylated and truncated TDP-43 was detectable in insoluble brain extracts 
      from affected white matter regions in FTLD-U, similar to the biochemical signature 
      observed in FTLD-U gray matter. Taken together, these results expand the spectrum of 
      TDP-43 pathology in FTLD-U, suggesting that white matter pathology might contribute 
      to the neurodegenerative process and clinical symptoms in FTLD-U.

TI  - [Progressive subcortical vascular encephalopathy of the Binswanger type (PSVE)].
PG  - 193-7
AB  - Histopathological diffuse pallor of the cerebral white matter on myelin staining is 
      a characteristic feature of progressive subcortical vascular encephalopathy of the 
      Binswanger type (PSVE). However, the reason for the diffuse pallor was unclear. In a 
      previous electron microscopic study the author reported that the number of nerve 
      fibers per unit area of the frontal white matter was significantly less in PSVE than 
      in the controls. The white matter pallor in PSVE is mainly related to the loss of 
      nerve fibers there. Dementia in PSVE is probably related to the loss of nerve fibers 
      in the cerebral white matter. The sum of the number of oligodendrocytes and 
      astrocytes in the deep white matter in PSVE was approximately half of that in 
      age-matched controls. The number of oligodendrocytes, which were defined as cells 
      with small, round and solid nuclei, also decreased in PSVE being half of that in the 
      deep white matter of the controls. These data suggest that the loss of 
      oligodendrocytes and astrocytes plays a role in the process of nerve fibers loss in 
      PSVE. Diffuse atherosclerotic lesions in the main stem of cerebral arteries and 
      severe hyalinotic changes in the white matter arterioles are characteristic arterial 
      lesions of PSVE. On the basis of severe arteriosclerosis in the cerebral arteries, 
      it was speculated that repeated hypotension or greater variability of casual blood 
      pressure could induce PSVE in the elderly hypertensives. To confirm the hypothesis, 
      casual blood pressure in PSVE was retrospectively studied.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250

TI  - Quantitative neuropathological changes in presymptomatic Huntington's disease.
PG  - 29-34
AB  - Morphometric studies of the tail of the caudate nucleus, the site where the 
      pathology is first seen, were performed on 16 brain specimens collected from 
      individuals at risk for inheriting Huntington's disease (HD). Medical records and 
      information obtained from immediate family members indicated that all had died 
      without symptoms of HD. Six individuals had 37 or more CAG repeats and were 
      designated HD gene carriers, whereas 10 were determined to be non-carriers. Cell 
      counts of the tail of the caudate nucleus revealed an increased density of 
      oligodendrocytes among the presymptomatic HD gene carriers (mean cells/field: 
      carriers = 40.0, noncarrier = 21.3; age, sex, repeated measure adjusted F[126] = 
      11.7, p = 0.0008). No statistically significant differences were found between HD 
      carriers and noncarriers in the density of neurons (carriers = 16.9, noncarriers = 
      15.5), astrocytes (carriers = 27.8, noncarriers = 21.3) or microglial cells 
      (carriers = 7.9, noncarriers = 5.6). Ubiquitin immunostaining performed in 3 gene 
      carriers revealed intranuclear inclusions in all 3 cases, including 1, with 37 
      repeats, who died 3 decades before the expected age for onset of the clinical 
      syndrome. Normal densities of other cell types and careful macroscopic examination 
      suggest that the increase in oligodendroglial density is not a consequence of 
      atrophy and may instead reflect a developmental effect of the HD gene.

TI  - Expression of major histocompatibility complex and HIV antigens within the brains of 
      AIDS patients.
PG  - 535-41
AB  - HIV establishes a chronic infection in the central nervous system (CNS) of AIDS 
      patients. The immunopathogenesis of this chronic encephalitis is unknown. Because of 
      the importance of major histocompatibility (MHC) class I and class II antigens in 
      modulating the immune response, we examined the tissue expression of MHC molecules 
      in relation to CNS damage and expression of viral antigens. By immunocytochemical 
      staining we found that beta 2-microglobulin (beta 2M) expression is elevated in all 
      cases with signs of viral encephalitis. beta 2M was expressed at high levels on 
      endothelial cells, macrophages and possible oligodendroglia within regions of 
      histopathology. In histologically normal regions elevated expression of beta 2M was 
      noted only on endothelial cells. MHC class II expression was elevated only in the 
      HIV encephalitis cases, and was restricted to macrophages/microglia and occasional 
      endothelial cells. When compared with other viral encephalitides these findings 
      suggest that the intra-CNS immune response to HIV is appropriate for viral 
      presentation; however, the absence of responsive systemic T cells may lead to 
      chronic viral infection.

TI  - Genetic deletion of BACE1 in mice affects remyelination of sciatic nerves.
PG  - 2970-80
LID - 10.1096/fj.08-106666 [doi]
AB  - BACE1 is a promising therapeutic and preventive target for Alzheimer's disease 
      because it is essential for amyloid deposition. However, the recent demonstration of 
      BACE1 in modulating developmental myelination in both peripheral and central nervous 
      systems raises a concern of its effect on myelin maintenance or remyelination, and 
      inhibition of these processes will potentially be detrimental to the BACE1 inhibitor 
      users who are susceptible to myelination diseases such as adult peripheral nerve 
      injury or multiple sclerosis. In this report, we investigated the role of BACE1 
      during peripheral nerve remyelination in wild-type (WT) and BACE1-null mice. We show 
      here that genetic deletion of BACE1 affects sciatic nerve remyelination. The 
      impaired remyelination appears to stem from the loss of neuregulin-1 cleavage by 
      BACE1. To demonstrate a direct cleavage of neuregulin-1 by BACE1, we have identified 
      a BACE1 cleavage site that turns out be highly conserved among neuregulin-1 
      paralogues. Moreover, we show that neuregulin-1 family member neuregulin-3 is also 
      cleavable by BACE1. We hypothesize that the BACE1-cleaved extracellular domain of 
      axonal neuregulin-1, perhaps neuregulin-3 as well, binds to Schwann cell ErbB 
      receptors, which in turn regulate remyelination. Pharmacological inhibition of BACE1 
      should be carefully monitored to avoid alteration of signaling pathway that 
      regulates remyelination.

TI  - Axonal degeneration induced by targeted expression of mutant human tau in 
      oligodendrocytes of transgenic mice that model glial tauopathies.
PG  - 9434-43
AB  - Abundant filamentous tau inclusions in oligodendrocytes (OLGs) are hallmarks of 
      neurodegenerative tauopathies, including sporadic corticobasal degeneration and 
      hereditary frontotemporal dementia with parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17 
      (FTDP-17). However, mechanisms of neurodegeneration in these tauopathies are unclear 
      in part because of the lack of animal models for experimental analysis. We address 
      this by generating transgenic (Tg) mice expressing human tau exclusively in OLGs 
      using the 2',3'-cyclic nucleotide 3'-phosphodiesterase promoter. Filamentous OLG tau 
      inclusions developed in these Tg mice as a result of human tau expression in OLGs, 
      especially those expressing the FTDP-17 human P301L mutant tau. Notably, structural 
      disruption of myelin and axons preceded the emergence of thioflavin-S positive tau 
      inclusions in OLGs, but impairments in axonal transport occurred even earlier, 
      whereas motor deficits developed subsequently, especially in Tg mice with the 
      highest tau expression levels. These data suggest that the accumulation of tau in 
      OLG cause neurodegeneration, and we infer they do so by disrupting axonal transport. 
      We suggest that similar defects may also occur in sporadic and hereditary human 
      tauopathies with OLG tau pathologies.

PG  - 562-9
AB  - Subacute encephalitis, characterized by demyelination, gliosis of the gray and white 
      matter, focal necrosis, microglial nodules, atypical oligodendrocyte nuclei, and 
      multinucleation of cells, was present in 27 of 30 (90%) autopsied patients with 
      acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) or AIDS-related complex. Subacute 
      encephalitis was mainly distributed in the frontal (58%) and temporal (69%) lobes, 
      basal ganglia (77%), amygdala (80%), and hippocampus (64%). Ten (37%) with moderate 
      or severe subacute encephalitis were demented; 82% with mild subacute encephalitis 
      had no recognized neurologic disorder. Human T-lymphotropic virus type III 
      (HTLV-III) was isolated from neural tissue or CSF in 11 of 13 patients, 10 with 
      subacute encephalitis, and 1 without CNS lesions. We conclude that subacute 
      encephalitis is common in AIDS patients and is most likely caused by CNS infection 
      with HTLV-III.

TI  - Association of human herpesvirus 6 with the demyelinative lesions of progressive 
      multifocal leukoencephalopathy.
PG  - 363-73
AB  - Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML) is a primary demyelinating disease 
      of the central nervous system occurring almost exclusively in individuals with 
      impaired cell-mediated immunity. The JC polyoma virus has been accepted as the 
      etiologic agent ofPML. Using a two-step in-situ polymerase chain reaction procedure 
      to amplify and detect genomic DNA of human herpesvirus-6 (HHV6) in formalin-fixed 
      paraffin-embedded archival brain tissues, a high frequency of infected cells was 
      consistently detected in PML white matter both within and surrounding demyelinative 
      lesions and HHV6 genome was found mainly within oligodendrocytes. Lesser amounts of 
      HHV6 genome were detected in most normal, AIDS, and other neurological disease 
      control tissues. Immunocytochemistry for HHV6 antigens showed actively infected 
      nuclei of swollen oligodendrocytic morphology only within the demyelinative lesions 
      of PML but not in adjacent uninvolved tissue. In addition, no HHV6 antigens were 
      detectable in control tissues including brains of individuals with HIV-1 
      encephalopathy but without PML. Double immunohistochemical staining for JC virus 
      large T antigen and HHV6 antigens demonstrated co-labeling of many swollen 
      intralesional oligodendrocytes in the PML cases. The evidence suggests that HHV6 
      activation in conjunction with JC virus infection is associated with the 
      demyelinative lesions of PML.

AB  - We report on a case of dementia and extensive cerebral white matter abnormalities 
      seen on magnetic resonance-images which meet the criteria for leukoencephalopathy 
      with vanishing white matter. This is an inherited condition that was first thought 
      to occur only in children. Our patient shows that vanishing white matter should be 
      considered in adult patients with early-onset dementia and extensive white matter

TI  - Argyrophilic grain disease is associated with apolipoprotein E epsilon 2 allele.
PG  - 222-4
AB  - Argyrophilic grain disease (AGD) is a distinct degenerative disorder of the human 
      brain associated with the formation of abnormally phosphorylated tau protein. 
      AGD-related cytoskeletal changes are known to affect specific subsets of nerve cells 
      and oligodendrocytes. Here we demonstrate a remarkable association between the 
      apolipoprotein E (ApoE) epsilon2 allele and AGD. Individuals afflicted with AGD (n = 
      48) reveal a significantly higher frequency of the epsilon2 allele compared with 
      controls (n = 43) (22% versus 4%, P < 0.0002). The association between AGD and 
      epsilon2 allele of ApoE suggests that AGD can be distinguished from other 
      neurodegenerative disorders not only neuropathologically, but also genetically.

      antibodies in HIV-1 infected individuals with or without central nervous system 
      complications.
PG  - 153-6
AB  - Myelin degeneration is commonly found in the central nervous system (CNS) of 
      individuals infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), especially in 
      patients with HIV-1-associated dementia. We analysed cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and 
      serum samples from 25 HIV-1 infected individuals for the presence of antibodies 
      directed against sulfatide, the major acidic glycosphingolipid in myelin. Nine of 
      the patients had CNS complications, including 3 with HIV-1-associated dementia, and 
      16 had no neurological symptoms. Elevated titres of anti-sulfatide antibodies were 
      found in serum from 24/25 HIV-1-infected individuals but in none of them in the CSF. 
      Although the vast majority of HIV-1-infected individuals harbour autoantibodies 
      directed against sulfatide in serum, the lack of detectable intrathecal production 
      indicates that anti-sulfatide antibodies are not a major component in the 
      pathogenesis of CNS myelin damage in HIV-1 infection.

TI  - Neurocognitive dysfunction predicts postmortem findings of HIV encephalitis.
PG  - 1563-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the value of antemortem cognitive functioning in 
      predicting postmortem evidence of HIV encephalitis (HIVE). METHODS: Thirty-nine 
      subjects were assessed during life with a comprehensive neuropsychological battery 
      and went on to autopsy within 18 months of testing. Cognitive impairment was 
      determined by blind clinical ratings, based on demographically corrected test 
      scores. Presence of HIVE was based on postmortem immunocytochemical detection of the 
      viral protein gp41 or by measurement of HIV RNA by PCR in multiple brain areas as 
      well as by histopathologic evidence such as microgliosis, presence of multinucleated 
      giant cells, and myelin pallor in several brain regions. RESULTS: The sensitivity 
      and specificity of neurocognitive impairment in detecting the occurrence of HIVE 
      were 67 and 92%. Eighteen of 19 subjects with antemortem neurocognitive impairment 
      had evidence of HIV-related brain disease (positive predictive value = 95%). 
      CONCLUSION: Neuropsychological assessment can help select HIV-positive patients for 
      treatment of CNS disease.

TI  - Cerebrovascular pathology in Alzheimer's disease and leukoaraiosis.
PG  - 39-45
AB  - A high percentage of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) show evidence of white 
      matter degeneration known as leukoaraiosis (LA), which is due to chronic ischemia. 
      We found that the periventricular veins tend to become occluded by multiple layers 
      of collagen in the vessel walls in the elderly. This collagen deposition is 
      particularly excessive in LA lesions. Therefore, it is present in the brains of many 
      AD patients, along with other ischemia-causing cerebrovascular pathology. We found 
      evidence that there is severe loss of oligodendrocytes in LA, due to extensive 
      apoptosis. No evidence of inflammation was found in the LA lesions. In thick 
      celloidin sections of AD brain, we have obtained detailed 3D views of small (early) 
      deposits of amyloid (stained with beta-amyloid antibody) around capillaries (stained 
      with collagen IV antibody).

TI  - Cell death in Alzheimer's disease evaluated by DNA fragmentation in situ.
PG  - 35-41
AB  - Loss of nerve cells is a hallmark of the pathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD), yet 
      the patterns of cell death are unknown. By analyzing DNA fragmentation in situ we 
      found evidence for cell death not only of nerve cells but also of oligodendrocytes 
      and microglia in AD brains. In average, 30 times more brain cells showed DNA 
      fragmentation in AD as compared to age-matched controls. Nuclear alterations 
      suggestive of apoptosis were rare in degenerating cells. Even though the majority of 
      degenerating cells were not located within amyloid deposits and did not contain 
      neurofibrillary tangles, neurons situated within areas of amyloid deposits or 
      affected by neurofibrillary degeneration revealed a higher risk of DNA fragmentation 
      and death than cells not exposed to these AD changes.

PG  - 284-9
AB  - A 12-year-old, hemophilic boy died with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) 
      after a clinical course characterized by progressive psycho-organic syndrome and 
      opportunistic infections. Postmortem neuropathological examination revealed a 
      cerebral form of neoplastic angioendotheliomatosis (NAE), leukoencephalopathy, giant 
      cell encephalitis and meningo-cerebral cryptococcosis. The most unusual finding was 
      the presence of proliferated neoplastic cells within lumina of some blood vessels 
      throughout the central nervous system (CNS). These cells displayed cytologic 
      features of malignancy and stained positively for common leukocyte antigen. Coronal 
      sections showed diffuse cerebral and cerebellar leukoencephalopathy with most 
      pronounced loss of myelin and axons in deep white matter, while the subcortical 
      arcuate fibers and the corpus callosum were partially spared. In these areas 
      numerous small foci of severe myelin loss were present. Microglial nodules and 
      distinctive multinucleated giant cells (MGC) were numerous. Intracytoplasmic and 
      intranuclear acidophilic inclusions were found in a few multinuclear and mononuclear 
      cells. Close contact between mononuclear and multinuclear cells suggesting their 
      fusion was also observed. As far as we know this is the first case of NAE 
      encountered in AIDS, one of the rare primary cerebral forms and the youngest 
      reported case of NAE up to now. This case could be considered as one proof more that 
      NAE is a special form of malignant lymphoma.

TI  - Argyrophilic grain disease: case report of the first two cases in the Czech Republic 
      and review of the literature.
PG  - 66-70
AB  - Argyrophilic grain disease (AgD) is a relatively newly described neurodegenerative 
      disease with late-onset dementia. Morphologically it is characterized by the 
      presence of abundant spindle-shaped argyrophilic grains (ArG) in neuronal processes 
      and coiled bodies in oligodendrocytes. ArG consist of abnormally hyperphosphorylated 
      form of tau protein. AgD is a substrate of at least 5% of all dementia cases with 
      increasing incidence in the old age. Here we report the cases of a 91-year-old woman 
      and an 83-year-old man clinically diagnosed with dementia. Neuropathological, 
      histochemical and immunohistochemical examination of the brain tissue show the 
      changes to be compatible with a definite diagnosis of AgD. This is the first 
      description of two cases of AgD in the Czech Republic.

      pathological conditions that induce microglial activation - brain injury and a model 
      of Alzheimer's disease. Although microglia are in close physical proximity to glia 
      and neurons, they do not form functional gap junctions under these pathological 
      conditions.

TI  - AIDS-associated progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML): comparison to 
      non-AIDS PML with in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry.
PG  - 1073-8
AB  - We studied brain sections from 10 patients with the acquired immunodeficiency 
      syndrome (AIDS) and progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) by in situ 
      hybridization with a biotin-labeled JC virus (JCV) DNA probe and by 
      immunohistochemistry using antibody against the JCV capsid antigen. We compared the 
      results with brain sections studied in the same fashion from 10 PML patients without 
      AIDS. The pathology of JCV infection in AIDS was similar to non-AIDS PML except for 
      minor differences in degree. AIDS-associated pathologic material showed a greater 
      tendency toward necrosis and a higher density of JCV-infected cells. Replication of 
      JCV was restricted to glial cells in all tissue studied. Bizarre astrocytes were 
      less frequent in the AIDS patients, and perivascular inflammatory cells were more 
      frequent. We could not demonstrate JCV in macrophages or microglial cells known to 
      harbor HIV infection. In situ hybridization with nonradioactive probes serves as a 
      useful technique for the confirmation of PML in AIDS.

TI  - An autopsy case of adult-onset hereditary spastic paraplegia type 2 with a novel 
      mutation in exon 7 of the proteolipid protein 1 gene.
PG  - 775-81
LID - 10.1007/s00401-011-0916-x [doi]
AB  - We report an autopsy case of rare adult-onset spastic paraplegia type 2 (SPG2) with 
      a novel missense mutation in exon 7 of the proteolipid protein 1 gene (PLP1). The 
      patient was a 67-year-old man whose elder brother had died of a similar disease with 
      onset in his 40s. Thirty-three years before death at the age of 35, he noticed 
      difficulty in walking. He gradually became abasic over a period of 6 years. He also 
      developed progressive dementia and eventually became bed-ridden by 28 years after 
      onset. At autopsy, gross inspection revealed diffuse, moderate atrophy of the 
      cerebrum with a dilated ventricular system and softening of the white matter 
      throughout the central nervous system (CNS). Histopathologically, the CNS showed 
      widespread myelin pallor in the white matter. By contrast, the gray matter and 
      peripheral nerves were well preserved. Some white matter tracts, including the 
      corticospinal tracts, were preferentially affected, and severe axonal degeneration 
      was observed in these tracts. Genetic analysis revealed a novel mutation, 
      p.Tyr263Cys, in exon 7 of PLP1. This case represents an adult-onset SPG2 patient 
      with one of the oldest ages of onset reported to date. The late onset and long 
      clinical course suggest that this novel mutation does not affect the maturation of 
      oligodendrocytes, but is related to insufficient maintenance of myelin.

TI  - Glial cytoplasmic inclusions in white matter oligodendrocytes of multiple system 
      atrophy brains contain insoluble alpha-synuclein.
PG  - 415-22
AB  - Recently, alpha-synuclein was shown to be a structural component of the filaments in 
      Lewy bodies (LBs) of Parkinson's disease (PD), dementia with LBs (DLB) as well as 
      the LB variant of Alzheimer's disease, and this suggests that alpha-synuclein could 
      play a mechanistic role in the pathogenesis of these disorders. To determine whether 
      alpha-synuclein is a building block of inclusions in other neurodegenerative 
      movement disorders, we examined brains from patients with multiple system atrophy 
      (MSA) and detected alpha-synuclein, but not beta- or gamma-synuclein, in glial 
      cytoplasmic inclusions (GCIs) throughout the MSA brain. In MSA white matter, 
      alpha-synuclein-positive GCIs were restricted to oligodendrocytes, and 
      alpha-synuclein was localized to the filaments in GCIs by immunoelectron microscopy. 
      Finally, we demonstrated that insoluble alpha-synuclein accumulated selectively in 
      MSA white matter with alpha-synuclein-positive GCIs. Taken together with evidence 
      that LBs contain insoluble alpha-synuclein, our data suggest that a reduction in the 
      solubility of alpha-synuclein may induce this protein to form filaments that 
      aggregate into cytoplasmic inclusions, which contribute to the dysfunction or death 
      of glial cells as well as neurons in neurodegenerative disorders with different 
      phenotypes.

AB  - Autonomic nervous system functions were studied in two patients with subacute 
      spongiform encephalopathy (SSE) and compared with those of four patients with 
      presenile dementia-Huntington's disease and Alzheimer's disease. Autonomic 
      dysfunctions in patients with SSE included the following: diminished lacrimation; 
      abnormal pupillary responses to topically applied autonomic drugs; subnormal pulse 
      rate in response to the cold face test and atropine administration; anhidrosis and 
      absence of a rise in blood pressure in response to the cold pressor test. These 
      functions were normal in dementia patients who served as controls. Postmortem 
      studies disclosed morphologic alterations in the sympathetic ganglia and vagus 
      nerve.

TI  - Hydrated autoclave pretreatment enhances tau immunoreactivity in formalin-fixed 
      normal and Alzheimer's disease brain tissues.
PG  - 693-702
AB  - We developed a new immunohistochemical method by which normal tau antigenicity can 
      be visualized in paraffin sections of formalin-fixed brain tissue. This method 
      consists of autoclave pretreatment of sections immersed into distilled water 
      (hydrated autoclaving) before incubation with anti-tau antibodies. In normal human 
      brain, immunoreactive tau was detected in neuronal cell bodies and dendrites, axon 
      fibers, astroglia, oligodendroglia and gray matter neuropil. In previous studies on 
      normal tau distribution, different optimized fixations that effectively preserve tau 
      antigenicity were used but none of these revealed all of these compartments 
      together. Our method is therefore considered to be more sensitive for detecting 
      normal tau immunoreactivity. In addition, hydrated autoclaving had an enhancing 
      effect on the abnormally phosphorylated (modified) tau immunoreactivity in 
      formalin-fixed brains. In hydrated autoclaving of sections from patients with 
      Alzheimer's disease, neuropil threads, senile plaques, extracellular and 
      intracellular tangles were enhanced in quantity and in staining intensity. 
      Therefore, modified tau appears to accumulate more densely than expected from 
      conventional immunohistochemistry. Immunoblot analysis showed that normal or 
      modified tau immunoreactivity was totally or partially eliminated on formalin 
      treatment and could be revisualized by hydrated autoclaving, an event presumably 
      related to recovering of formalin-masked tau antigens through denaturation by 
      hydrated autoclaving.

TI  - [Pathogenesis of neurological disorders in AIDS].
PG  - 2912-8
AB  - Impairment of the central nervous system (CNS) and peripheral nervous system (PNS) 
      is common during the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection. There 
      are evidences of activated immune reactions in the CNS and PNS of patients with 
      acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). The expression of HIV-1 predominantly in 
      monocyte/macrophage lineage cells strongly suggests immunopathogenetic mechanisms. 
      Possible mechanisms of neuronal and glial cell damage include calcium dependent 
      excitotoxicity by HIV-1 envelope protein, N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) 
      receptor-mediated neurotoxicity of quinolinic acid, injury of oligodendrocytes by 
      tumor necrosis factor--alpha, cell injury by HIV-1-specific cytotoxic T cells, and 
      apoptosis of oligodendrocytes or neurons. These mechanisms are not mutually 
      exclusive. Multiple factors may be involved in the pathogenesis of HIV-1-associated 
      neurological diseases.

TI  - Multifocal vacuolar leucoencephalopathy: a distinct HIV-associated lesion of the 
      brain.
PG  - 437-43
AB  - A 20-year-old male AIDS patient developed rapidly progressive dementia for more than 
      3 months prior to death. Autopsy showed, in addition to adrenal cytomegalovirus 
      (CMV) infection and focal cerebral necrosis due to toxoplasmosis, multifocal 
      subcortical white matter lesions of the brain which were strikingly similar to the 
      histopathology of vacuolar myelopathy in AIDS. These distinct lesions contained 
      macrophages which were rarely multinucleated and expressed HIV antigens by 
      immunocytochemistry. The distribution of lesions mimics extrapontine myelinolysis 
      and progressive multifocal leucoencephalopathy (PML); PML was excluded by the 
      absence of papovaviruses by immunocytochemistry and by in situ DNA hybridization. 
      Tissue damage in multifocal vacuolar leucoencephalopathy is different from hitherto 
      characterized HIV-specific neuropathology such as HIV encephalitis and HIV 
      leucoencephalopathy, and should be included in the list of conditions with damage of 
      the brain white matter in AIDS.

TI  - Myelinated axon undergoes complete demyelination in the panencephalopathic--but it 
      is merely subjected to the Wallerian degeneration in the polioencephalopathic type 
      of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies.
PG  - 163-71
AB  - We report here on axon and myelin changes in panencephalopathic type of 
      Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease as opposed to polioencephalopathic models of scrapie. In 
      CJD, myelinated axons presented various pathological changes. Initially the myelin 
      sheath was separated by cytoplasmic tongues into several concentric bands. Cellular 
      processes penetrated between layers of myelin and lifted away the outermost 
      lamellae. Then a complicated labyrinth of concentric cellular processes, clearly 
      belonging to either astrocytes or macrophages invested myelinated axons. In terminal 
      stages axons completely denuded of myelin were seen in the centre of a concentric 
      network of cellular processes or spirals of myelin were seen surrounded by such 
      processes. The myelin fragments penetrated into astrocytes or macrophages where they 
      underwent final digestion. Macrophages containing fragments of axons, 
      paracrystalline lamellar bodies and myelin debris were abundant in this model. In 
      two models of scrapie myelin dilatation, not unlike that seen in the 
      panencephalopathic type of CJD was observed. Several altered axons were also seen, 
      but these presented only typical features of Wallerian degeneration. Even the most 
      damaged fibres consisted of "empty" vacuoles (the axon itself was lost) surrounded 
      by a narrow rim of oligodendroglial cytoplasm. Thus, myelinated fibre degeneration 
      in this polioencephalopathic model merely represents the sequel to preceding 
      neuronal degeneration. In conclusion, it seems that myelinated fibres are eventually 
      denuded of myelin in the panencephalopathic type of CJD but undergo Wallerian 
      degeneration in polioencephalopathic types of scrapie. Because myelin dilatation is 
      observed in both pan- and polioencephalopathic type of TSE and because their 
      formation is probably mediated by cytokines released from astrocytes and microglia, 
      we hypothesised that this mechanism operates early in the fibre destruction and must 
      be supplemented later in the course of the disease by other, currently unknown 
      mechanisms.

AB  - A 78-year-old male with renal carcinoma was treated with a high dose infusion of 
      interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) for eight months. The patient had evidence of organic 
      brain syndrome such as dysfunction of memory, slowing of behavior, and development 
      of mental confusion that appeared eight months after the treatment. MRI at the time 
      of mental confusion revealed diffuse white matter lesions. Neuropathologic findings 
      were compatible to Binswanger's disease and Senile Dementia of Alzheimer Type 
      (SDAT), Preexisting neurologic abnormalities including intracerebral 
      arteriosclerosis and cerebral atrophy may increase susceptibility to unacceptably 
      severe IFN neurotoxicity.

AB  - A study was conducted on the fatty acid composition of cerebroside, sulfatide and 
      ganglioside in the brains of 4 cases of Nasu-Hakola disease. The percentage of short 
      carbon chain (C.16-C.18) nonhydroxy fatty acids of sulfatide in the cortex was much 
      higher than that of the control and long-chain (C.24-) fatty acids showed a lower 
      percentage. Sulfatide in the white matter was of the same tendency. The percentage 
      of C.16:0 palmitic acid of ganglioside in the cortex was much larger than that of 
      the control. Referring to the fatty acid composition of lipids in the literature, 
      abnormalities of the fatty acid concentration, namely a high percentage of 
      short-chain fatty acids of sulfatide and ganglioside in the cerebral cortex of the 
      present cases, were confirmed.

TI  - Development of Alzheimer-related neurofibrillary changes in the neocortex inversely 
      recapitulates cortical myelogenesis.
PG  - 197-201
AB  - The pattern of neurofibrillary changes which gradually develops in the course of 
      Alzheimer's disease bears a striking resemblance to the inverse sequence of cortical 
      myelination. Factors released by oligodendrocytes exert a strong influence upon 
      nerve cells and suppress disordered neuritic outgrowth. It is suggested that the 
      lack of such factors due to premature dysfunction of oligodendrocytes leads to 
      alterations of the neuronal cytoskeleton and eventually to the appearance of 
      Alzheimer-type neurofibrillary changes.

TI  - [Hereditary spongiform dystrophy in young children (Canavan: van Bogaert-Bertrand)].
PG  - 159-85
AB  - Hereditary spongiform dystrophy in young children is characterised by macrocephaly 
      with spasticity, convulsions and ultimately a decerebrate state and diffuse 
      electroencephalographic changes. Histological examination of the brain remains 
      essential for its diagnosis. A review of the ultrastructural studies reported by 
      various authors complements the findings obtained by conventional histology. We have 
      thus endeavoured to determine whether van Bogaert-Bertrand's disease is to be 
      considered as congenital or acquired. The anatomical findings in 3 cases together 
      with the descriptions of other authors lead us to the following conclusions: -that 
      the spongiform changes may be due to an osmolar disequilibrium in which the 
      ATPase-Na/K relation with mitochondrial abnormalities is yet unclear. -that the 
      constant finding of Alzheimer type II cells is certainly an indication of 
      intra-astrocytic malfunction. -that the oedema blocks both myelin synthesis and its 
      coiling into lamellae. Case 1, which showed a long survival compared to others 
      described (about 4 years), enabled us to study terminal lesions. Sub-cortical zones, 
      in both cerebrum and cerebellum, contained neither myelin nor spongiform cavities, 
      but, on the other hand, showed a compact glio-fibrillosis with large vesicles and 
      oligodendroglia of increased density. We have interpreted these lesions, 
      progressively replaced by spongiosis deeper in the cortex, as evidence of retracted 
      scar tissue. Differences found between cerebral weights seem to confirm this 
      hypothesis.

TI  - Ferritin is a component of the neuritic (senile) plaque in Alzheimer dementia.
PG  - 105-10
AB  - A strong immunoreactivity for ferritin was observed in the neuritic (senile) plaques 
      in Alzheimer's disease hippocampus. The ferritin accumulation was almost exclusively 
      associated with the microglia, which appeared to have proliferated greatly. These 
      cells were also positive for HLA-DR, a putative marker for reactive microglia. In 
      contrast, in the diffuse plaques, which were without neuritic pathology, the 
      ferritin-stained microglia appeared to be normal. Microglia were seen frequently in 
      contact with neurons undergoing neurofibrillary changes but only the tangles in the 
      extracellular space were ferritin positive. No ferritin was detected, by Western 
      blots, in paired helical filaments isolated from Alzheimer's disease brain, 
      suggesting that ferritin was most likely weakly associated with and was not a 
      constituent of these fibrils. No correlation between increased ferritin/microglia 
      activity and blood-brain barrier leakage was detected. Ferritin, an iron-storage 
      protein, might have a role in the formation of amyloid through the action of free 
      radicals generated during the release of iron from the ferritin molecule. 
      Alternatively, the ferritin/microglia system might be secondarily involved in the 
      removal and processing of the amyloid.

AB  - This is a report of an autopsy case (45-year-old woman) of adult neuronal ceroid 
      lipofuscinosis with a long-lasting course of 25 years. In the course of her illness, 
      gait disturbance, bulbar palsy and dementia were observed. Pathologically severe 
      neuronal loss and hemosiderin-like granules were found in the cortex, basal nuclei, 
      thalamus and others. The residual cells of these tissues were swollen with 
      lipofuscin-like pigments. The extremely swollen nerve cells were found in the 
      anterior horn of the spinal cord. Electron microscopically, numerous curvilinear 
      bodies, myelin figures and fingerprint profiles were seen in those cytoplasms. 
      Ceroid and lipofuscin were proven by a histochemical examination.

TI  - The pathophysiology of reactive oxygen intermediates in the central nervous system.
PG  - 223-30
AB  - Current evidence for the participation of free radicals in diseases of the central 
      nervous system is reviewed. We conclude that the pathogenesis is based on a uniform 
      mechanism: free radicals preferentially attack myelin, which contains easily 
      peroxidizable phospholipids. The basal ganglia seem to be a brain area that is 
      especially susceptible to radical damage which is possibly related to the synthesis 
      of neurotransmitters. The clinical picture of the resulting cell death is dominated 
      by convulsions and retardation in childhood and by psychomotoric disability and 
      dementia in adulthood.

PG  - 341-4
AB  - The cerebellar cortex of progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) cases exhibited a 
      characteristic pathology which occurred neither in healthy aged individuals nor in 
      cases of fully developed Alzheimer's disease. All of the 11 PSP cases studied reveal 
      altered mossy fiber excrescences containing abnormal and hyperphosphorylated tau 
      protein. Moreover, this abnormal material also appeared in cerebellar 
      oligodendrocytes. Accordingly, there is not only the destruction of the cerebellar 
      output system, which is already known, but also the involvement of the cerebellar 
      input system.

TI  - Prolonged progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy without immunosuppression.
PG  - 603-7
AB  - Atypical forms of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) may simulate 
      other disorders. A previously healthy 70-year-old female developed unsteadiness of 
      gait, dysarthria, dementia and weakness leading to inanition and death from 
      bronchopneumonia over a 43 month period. The diagnosis of PML was not suspected 
      prior to death. Neuropathologic examination of the brain disclosed characteristic 
      findings of PML-deep bilateral cerebral demyelinative foci with enlarged 
      gemistocytic astrocytes and swollen oligodendrocytes containing intranuclear 
      inclusions. Electron microscopy identified papova virus particles within these 
      inclusions. An underlying source of immunosuppression was not identified either 
      premortem nor at the time of autopsy. The prolonged clinical course, simulating that 
      of a primary degenerative disease, and the lack of apparent immunocompromise are 
      unusual features of PML and lend credence to the suggestions that variations in its 
      expression and course are to be expected.

TI  - [A clinicopathologic study of progressive subcortical vascular encephalopathy of the 
      Binswanger type (PSVE)].
PG  - 54-5
AB  - From an electron microscopic study I indicated that the number of nerve fibres per 
      unit area in the frontal white matter was significantly less in PSVE than that in 
      controls. The white matter pallor in PSVE is mainly based on the loss of nerve 
      fibres. The dementia in PSVE is probably related to the loss of nerve fibres in the 
      cerebral white matter. The extent of frontal white matter pallor tended to be less 
      broad in vascular parkinsonism (VP) than in PSVE without parkinsonism. The 
      relatively slight damage of the white matter may contribute to VP observed in PSVE. 
      The number of oligodendrocytes and of astrocytes was decreased in PSVE showing half 
      of that in the deep white matter of the controls. This suggests that the loss of 
      oligodendrocytes and astrocytes can play a role to the process of nerve fibres loss 
      in PSVE. Not only the severe hyalinotic changes in the white matter arterioles, but 
      also the diffuse atherosclerotic lesions in the main stem of cerebral arteries were 
      the characteristic arterial lesions in PSVE. On the basis of these arteriosclerotic 
      lesions, we speculated that the repeated hypotension or the greater variability of 
      casual blood pressure could induce PSVE in the elderly hypertensives. However, the 
      retrospective analysis of casual blood pressure did not support our hypothesis.

      immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antigens.
PG  - 497-503
AB  - Vacuolar myelopathy (VM) is a frequent neurological complication of the acquired 
      immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). A suspected connection between VM and human 
      immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has been based only on HIV isolation from affected 
      spinal cord tissue. We report here an AIDS patient dying after 14 months of 
      progressive dementia, including 3 months of spinal signs and symptoms. At autopsy, 
      the brain revealed moderate diffuse damage of the white matter compatible with 
      HIV-induced progressive diffuse leukoencephalopathy. The spinal cord showed VM 
      mainly in the lateral and the posterior columns. Mono- and multinucleated 
      macrophages were localized within intramyelinic and periaxonal vacuoles. Light and 
      electron microscopic immunocytochemistry revealed the presence of HIV antigens 
      restricted to mono- and multinucleated macrophages within the spongy lesions. 
      Productive HIV infection is documented for the first time within VM lesions of this 
      case. Therefore, VM should be included among HIV-induced lesions of the central 
      nervous system. The intimate relation of infected macrophages to vacuolar 
      myelinopathy could suggest secretion of a myelinotoxic factor by macrophages 
      productively infected by HIV. Immune electron microscopy appears as promising tool 
      to detect HIV in tissue even when the density of virus may be low.

TI  - Cellular localization of messenger RNA encoding amyloid-beta-protein in normal 
      tissue and in Alzheimer disease.
PG  - 96-111
AB  - Amyloid precursor protein (APP) gene encodes the short peptide fragment 
      amyloid-beta-protein present in senile plaque cores, cerebrovascular amyloid, and 
      intracellular neurofibrillary tangles in Alzheimer disease (AD). Using in situ 
      hybridization with biotin-labeled RNA probes, we found distinctive patterns of APP 
      gene expression in different regions of postmortem human brain. Strong hybridization 
      signal for APP messenger RNA (mRNA) was detected in specific classes of neurons, 
      fascicular oligodendroglia, satellite glia, and presumptive microglia. Weaker signal 
      was seen in other neuronal classes, fascicular astrocytes, and vascular endothelial 
      cells, but no signal was seen in protoplasmic astrocytes. Human thymus also shows a 
      restricted pattern of hybridization with high signal in reticular epithelial cells, 
      and much lower signal in lymphocytes. In AD patients, neuronal hybridization for APP 
      mRNA was specifically increased in hippocampus, but not cerebellar and visual cortex 
      when compared to hybridization for neuron-specific enolase mRNA. Most neurons with 
      neurofibrillary tangles had strong APP mRNA signal. These results suggest that APP 
      gene expression is highly regulated in normal tissue, that many different cell 
      classes in brain express the APP gene, and that neuronal expression may increase 
      specifically in brain regions where widespread injury occurs in AD. Amyloid deposits 
      in brains of AD patients might be explained by local production of precursor protein 
      in endothelial cells, neurons or glia.

TI  - Mechanism of the damage to myelinated axons in experimental Creutzfeldt-Jakob 
      disease in mice: an ultrastructural study.
PG  - 545-50
AB  - We report the ultrastructural pathology of myelinated axons in mice infected 
      experimentally with the Fujisaki strain of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD). 
      Initially the myelin sheath was separated into several concentric bands, and 
      cellular processes penetrated between layers of myelin and lifted away the outermost 
      lamella. Then a complicated labyrinth of the concentric cellular processes, clearly 
      belonging to either astrocytes or macrophages, invested myelinated axons. In 
      terminal stages axons completely denuded of myelin were seen in the center of 
      concentric networks of cellular processes. Myelin remnants were seen within 
      astrocytes and macrophages. We conclude that the mechanism(s) of damage to 
      myelinated axons in CJD may be similar to that operating in immunologically mediated 
      demyelinating disorders.

PG  - 85-92
AB  - We report a case of Creutzfeldt-Jakob (CJD) disease in a 72-year-old man without 
      characteristic EEG alterations. Unusually abundant pleomorphic PrP-immunopositive 
      amyloid plaques were found in the cerebellum. Despite of this similarity with 
      Gerstmann-Străussler-Scheinker (GSS) disease the case cannot be classified as GSS 
      lacking classical GSS 102 PRNP gene mutation. The ultrastructural findings were 
      similar to those described previously for CJD. The close contact of reactive 
      astrocytes with both oligodendroglia and microglia in this case suggests their 
      possible functional interaction.

TI  - The restricted nature of HIV-1 tropism for cultured neural cells.
PG  - 813-25
AB  - Infection of the central nervous system by HIV-1, the agent of AIDS, is 
      characterized by the presence of infected and giant microglial cells as well as 
      astrocytosis, demyelination, and neuronal loss. To determine whether cells of 
      neuroectoderm origin can be infected by HIV-1, we have inoculated primary cultures 
      derived from adult human brain with a lymphotropic virus (LAV) or a neurotropic 
      virus (Jr-FL) isolated from a patient with AIDS dementia. While Jr-FL invariably 
      causes productive infection of cultured brain microglia, neither astrocytes nor 
      oligodendrocytes became productively infected by these viral strains. Moreover, the 
      cultured oligodendrocytes develop a normal network of processes and express 
      differentiation antigens in the presence of an ongoing lytic infection of microglial 
      cells. No HIV-1 proviral DNA was detected in primary astrocyte cultures devoid of 
      microglial after inoculation of either HIV-1 strain. Similarly, the neuronal cell 
      line HCN-1 in its differentiated state did not allow the virus to go through cycles 
      of reverse transcription and replication. LAV, however, was able to replicate in 
      undifferentiated HCN-1 cells. Thus, tropism of HIV-1 appears tightly restricted to 
      only one type of differentiated cell in the CNS, the microglia.

TI  - Pick's disease immunohistochemistry: new alterations and Alzheimer's disease 
      comparisons.
PG  - 322-30
AB  - Pick's disease (PD) brains were examined immunohistochemically for the expression of 
      antigens known to be associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) lesions. Most 
      antibodies which label intracellular neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) in AD were found 
      to stain Pick bodies (PBs). Among them was the monoclonal antibody A2B5, which is 
      known to recognize neuronal surface gangliosides. This result indicates that 
      membrane proteins are probably incorporated into PBs as into NFTs. However, PBs, in 
      contrast to NFTs, showed a paucity of staining for heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycan 
      and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF). Staining for midkine, seen in senile 
      plaques in AD, was not seen in PD. The relative lack of staining for these two 
      neurotrophic factors in PD brain may reflect underlying mechanisms which are 
      distinct from those in AD. We also describe two glial abnormalities in PD: glial 
      fibrillary tangles and clusters of granules positive for the complement protein C4d 
      in the hippocampal dentate fascia. These are presumably related to 
      complement-activated oligodendroglia, and both pathological structures are more 
      abundant in advanced cases, suggesting that they may be hallmarks of the disease 
      progression.

AB  - Immunochemical studies were performed on Alzheimer's beta-amyloid precursor protein 
      (APP) in rat brain and cultured rat neural cells. Multiple APP subtypes were 
      detected on immunoblots of brain homogenate with several antisera specific for 
      subsequences of APP. In rat neural cell cultures, it was demonstrated that the 
      composition of APP subtypes differed among cell types and subcellular fractions, and 
      that APP subtypes in PC12h cells varied in their heparin binding affinity, 
      suggesting distinct functional roles for different APP subtypes. Compatible with the 
      possible role of APP in cell-matrix interaction, an increase in oligodendroglial APP 
      was observed following their attachment onto poly-L-lysine substratum.

TI  - Binswanger's disease: progressive subcortical encephalopathy or multi-infarct 
      dementia?
PG  - 88-94
AB  - Since Binswanger's description of subcortical arteriosclerotic encephalopathy in 
      1894, numerous cases have been reported. Several authors doubt the validity of this 
      malady, although the majority consider it to be a disease entity. We report seven 
      cases with this type of pallor of myelin, only two of which are accompanied by a 
      history of dementia. Among the seven cases, two had arteriosclerosis of penetrating 
      arteries and arterioles in cerebral white matter. Electron microscopy showed 
      splitting of myelin sheaths, probably the result of edema. In reviewing the blood 
      supply of the cerebral white matter, we conclude that no pathological alterations of 
      medullary branches of the cerebral arteries, the same vessels supplying the white 
      matter, can give rise to such diffuse pallor of white matter and spare the arcuate 
      fibres. This pallor can only be due to cerebral edema, most likely of 
      hypoxic-ischemic, hypotensive, or acidotic origin. We also contend that 
      arteriosclerosis can only cause dementia through multiple infarcts or lacunae, if it 
      indeed leads to dementia.

      patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.
PG  - 874-9
AB  - Twenty of 89 consecutive patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) 
      in whom autopsies were performed over a 3 1/2-year period had a vacuolar myelopathy 
      that was most severe in the lateral and posterior columns of the thoracic cord. 
      Light and electron microscopy showed that vacuoles were surrounded by a thin myelin 
      sheath and appeared to arise from swelling within myelin sheaths. Signs and symptoms 
      referable to the spinal-cord lesions, including paraparesis, often accompanied by 
      spasticity or ataxia (or both), were present in all five patients with marked 
      pathological changes, in five of seven patients with moderate changes, and in two of 
      eight patients with mild changes. Fourteen patients were demented. The clinical 
      presentation was sufficiently distinctive to provide a guide for antemortem 
      diagnosis. Possible causes of the vacuolar changes include uncharacterized viral 
      infection or a metabolic derangement related to selective nutritional deficiency.

AB  - The activity of 2',3'-cyclic nucleotide-3'-phosphodiesterase (CNPase) was determined 
      as an index of myelin in the post-mortem brain samples of 16 patients with 
      Alzheimer's disease (AD) and of 14 controls. The CNPase activity was mildly 
      increased in the temporal, hippocampal and parietal cortex in AD subjects pointing 
      to a relative sparing of myelin as compared to the neuron loss within cortex in AD. 
      In the hippocampus the CNPase activity was decreased in AD patients indicating loss 
      of myelin and thus myelinated axons in this area in AD.

PG  - 30-1
AB  - As part of the University of Western Ontario Dementia Study, the computed 
      tomographic brain scans of 16 patients were reviewed by three neuroradiologists. The 
      size of the ventricles and sulci were rated using a six-point scale. Infarction and 
      white matter changes were assessed in accordance with specified criteria. The 
      interobserver correlations in this small series were statistically significant in 17 
      of 20 items, and good or acceptable for infarction, leuko-araiosis, and ventricular 
      size. It is suggested that the use of rigid criteria for the definition of 
      abnormality helps to promote interobserver agreement.

AB  - An 80-year-old woman with slowly progressive dementia of at least 1 year's duration 
      died with an abrupt change in the rate and character of mental deterioration. 
      Pathologic examination of the brain showed Alzheimer's disease as well as 
      progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) in the parietal and cerebellar 
      areas. JC virus (JCV) was detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification 
      of paraffin sections from both PML and non-PML areas of the cerebrum. Analysis by in 
      situ hybridization and reverse transcriptase PCR in situ localized JC viral DNA and 
      RNA to the nuclei of oligodendrocytes only in the areas of demyelination. This case 
      is noteworthy in that PML occurred in the setting of Alzheimer's disease by presumed 
      activation of latent JCV in the absence of usual causes of immunocompromise.

      calcification and at necropsy there was evidence of widespread generalised myelin 
      loss with extensive Rosenthal fibre formation. The hypothesis that this may be an 
      adult form of Alexander's disease is discussed.

      Binswanger type (PSVE)].
PG  - 1335-8
AB  - To investigate the histopathological basis of white matter pallor on myelin staining 
      in PSVE, the frontal white matter was examined by electron microscopy in 7 cases 
      with PSVE. The number of nerve fibres per unit area of the white matter was 
      significantly less in PSVE compared with that in the control group or in senile 
      dementia of Alzheimer's type (SDAT). Nerve fibers in PSVE had a tendency to have 
      thinner myelin sheaths than in the control group or in SDAT, but the difference was 
      not significant. The white matter pallor in PSVE is mainly based on the loss of 
      nerve fibres. The dementia in PSVE is probably related to the loss of nerve fibres 
      in the cerebral white matter. A sum of oligodendrocytes and astrocytes per unit area 
      decreased in the area with white matter pallor. Main stem of cerebral arteries, 
      leptomeningeal arteries, medullary arteries in the cortex, and small arteries or 
      arterioles in the cerebral white matter were studied pathologically in 22 elderly 
      patients with PSVE. Not only the severe hyalinotic changes of arterioles in the 
      cerebral white matter, but also the diffuse atherosclerotic lesions in main stem of 
      cerebral arteries and/or the stenotic lesions in leptomeningeal arteries were the 
      characteristic arterial changes of PSVE. Angionecrosis was observed in 70% of the 
      PSVE patients. To substantiate my hypothesis that PSVE in the elderly can be induced 
      by the repeated hypotension or the greater variability of the casual blood pressure 
      in the hypertensives, I studied retrospectively the casual blood pressures in 
      PSVE.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

TI  - Morphological changes in the corpus callosum in chronic alcoholism.
PG  - 25-9
AB  - In a group of 66 patients (age 24 to 78 years) with the clinical diagnosis of 
      chronic alcoholism the changes in the corpus callosum were evaluated. The period of 
      alcohol abuse varied from 3 to over 30 years. In 57 cases atrophy of the corpus 
      callosum was noted. The trunk was involved most frequently. Myelin sheaths exhibited 
      abnormalities from slight pallor to total destruction. In 19 cases the damage of 
      myelin sheaths was restricted to disseminated, perivascular, spongy degenerations. 
      The vessels were sclerotic, especially periventricular ones exhibited degenerative 
      changes. Perivascular gliosis was also seen. Conclusions from the present study 
      indicate that the structural changes observed in the corpus callosum during chronic 
      alcohol abuse are connected with CNS involution and with degenerative changes within 
      vessels walls. The damage of myelin sheaths localized in our material similarly as 
      Marchiafava-Bignami disease, differs from the later by less advanced changes, 
      perivascular spreading of demyelination, and frequent destruction of axons.

TI  - Neuropathology of the central nervous system in acquired immune deficiency syndrome 
      (AIDS) in Japan. With special reference to human immunodeficiency virus-induced 
      encephalomyelopathies.
PG  - 206-11
AB  - The neuropathological features of the central nervous system in 15 autopsy cases of 
      Japanese male with AIDS were reported. Nine patients had various histological 
      changes including a variety of opportunistic infections in six patients (40%), 
      primary malignant lymphoma of the brain in two (13%), AIDS encephalopathy in four 
      (27%) and vacuolar myelopathy in one (7%). Usually, these pathological changes were 
      present concomitantly. AIDS encephalopathy was characterized by infiltration of 
      mono- and multinucleated cells and myelin pallor with astrogliosis located 
      predominantly in the cerebral white matter and subcortical gray matter. Furthermore, 
      unevenly distributed neuronal loss of the cerebral cortex was apparent in one case. 
      Diffuse astrocytosis of the gray matter out of proportion to neuronal loss was also 
      an outstanding finding in another case. The present study suggested that not only 
      the white matter changes but also gray matter alterations might be the morphological 
      substrates of AIDS encephalopathy.

TI  - Encephalitogenic peptide (EP) in human cerebrovascular white matter lesions.
PG  - 3727-30
AB  - The expression of encephalitogenic peptide (EP), a 68-86 amino acid sequence of 
      guinea pig myelin basic protein (MBP), was investigated in autopsied brains with 
      focal cerebral damage or with diffuse white matter (WM) lesions. EP immunoreactive 
      fibers were distributed in parallel with fibers immunoreactive for amyloid protein 
      precursor (APP), an indicator of WM damages. EP was expressed in the periphery of 
      cerebral infarctions and hematoma in the acute and subacute stages, but was also 
      distributed in diffuse WM lesions due to heterogeneous causes. These data indicate 
      that EP epitopes are exposed specifically in ongoing WM damages, and that the 
      destruction of myelin occurs sporadically in diffuse WM lesions of varying 
      intensity.

TI  - The white matter changes in microencephalic HIV infected infants. A preliminary 
      report.
PG  - 145-8
AB  - The brains of six infants 14-34 months of age and with microencephaly (brain weight 
      deficit 20-55.5%) were chosen from a group of cases vertically infected with HIV. 
      The center of our investigations was focused on the white matter changes of which 
      two types were observed in the examined brains. Within the periventricular white 
      matter of four cases evident lesions consisting of myelin pallor and concomitant 
      gliosis were recognized as HIV-1 infection related leukoencephalopathy. In all those 
      cases myelination delay was also noted. In one case HIV encephalitis was diagnosed. 
      Our observations suggest that in the majority of HIV infected infants changes 
      resulting in the brain "too small for age" corelate with myelination delay 
      coexisting with early-onset leukoencephalopathy. Because of the small number of 
      cases in this study the results should be considered preliminary, and will require 
      further investigations.

PG  - 749-54
AB  - This is a report of an autopsied case of dentatorubropallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA) 
      with atypical neuropathological findings. The patients was a 31-year-old female. Her 
      clinical symptoms were epileptic seizures, cerebellar ataxia, choreoathetosis and 
      dementia. A neuropathological examination revealed the fibrillary gliosis in various 
      areas of the CNS and severe degeneration in the cerebellar cortex and nucleus 
      fasciculi dorsalis in addition to a marked degeneration of the 
      dentatorubropallidoluysian systems. The present case is diagnosed 
      neuropathologically as DRPLA associated with the findings of chronic 
      diphenylhydantoin intoxication and epileptic brain damage.

TI  - [Results of clinical and immunoenzymatic studies of neurospecific leucine 
      aminopeptidase in patients with neurologic disorders].
PG  - 20-4
AB  - Leucine aminopeptidase of myelin was discovered to contain a protein subunit 
      possessing, in contrast to the main enzymatic mass, antigenic properties and 
      contained by different structures of the central nervous system. The protein was 
      shown to be accumulated by neurons and astrocytes of embryonic tissue culture. The 
      protein was absent from biological fluids of healthy persons and in schizophrenia 
      but it was recordable in the blood and cerebrospinal fluid of patients with 
      different forms of neurological pathology. In patients with neuronal degenerative 
      diseases, the protein level in biological fluids in the terminal stages was 
      significantly lower than in compensated patients.

TI  - alpha B-crystallin is present in reactive glia in Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.
PG  - 324-7
AB  - alpha-Crystallin is a major eye lens protein, composed of two types of subunits, 
      alpha A and alpha B. The alpha A subunit is restricted to the lens, but alpha 
      B-crystallin has recently also been detected in non-lenticular tissues, including 
      the nervous system. With the use of a polyclonal antiserum directed against a 
      synthetic C-terminal peptide of human alpha B-crystallin, the presence of alpha 
      B-crystallin could be demonstrated immunohistochemically in astrocytes in the brains 
      of patients with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD). Most intensive localization was 
      observed in the spongiotic tissue representing abundant progressively changed 
      astrocytes in CJD. In age-matched control brains weak positive reaction was located 
      in individual oligodendroglia cells and subpial astrocytes. Prominent increase of 
      alpha B-crystallin in pathological glia in CJD may represent a response to stress.

      syndrome (AIDS).
PG  - 122-5
AB  - Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy is a rare viral-induced demyelinating 
      disease associated to immunodeficiency. A 10-year-old boy with AIDS is reported, who 
      developed subacute cerebellar signs and symptoms with multiple cranial nerve 
      involvement and dementia. A computed tomography scan revealed a focal nonenhancing 
      area of low attenuation in the cerebellum. On magnetic resonance imaging high signal 
      lesions in T2 weighted sequences were shown. The biopsy of one of those lesions 
      showed the typical histological findings of progressive multifocal 
      leukoencephalopathy. It seems important to consider this diagnosis in children with 
      AIDS who present with progressive neurological features.

AB  - Anatomo-clinical findings are reported in a case of central nervous system 
      degeneration which began at age 47 and progressed over a three year period. 
      Information obtained prior to the patient's death suggested probable spinocerebellar 
      degeneration with amyotrophies. Postmortem anatomical examination confirmed this 
      diagnosis but also revealed the existence of unsuspected lesions. These clinically 
      non-manifested lesions involved severe pallido-luysian degeneration as well as 
      numerous and diffuse senile plaques. The nosological implications of this case are 
      discussed.

TI  - Leukoencephalopathy in patients treated with amphotericin B methyl ester.
PG  - 125-37
AB  - Clinical and autopsy studies of 14 patients treated with amphotericin B methyl ester 
      (AME) for focal, disseminated, and nervous system mycotic infections revealed a high 
      incidence of progressive neurologic dysfunction (dementia, akinesia, mutism, 
      hyperreflexia, and tremor) and diffuse white matter degeneration. All of seven 
      patients who received greater than 9.8 g of AME intravenously developed severe 
      neurologic and neuropathologic changes. Two of three patients given 5-7.2 g of AME 
      developed less severe neurologic symptoms; all three had mild diffuse white matter 
      gliosis. Four patients given less than 1.5 g of AME had no bran abnormalities except 
      those related to coccidioidal meningitis. Thirty-one control patients who died on 
      untreated or amphotericin B-treated coccidioidal meningitis showed no diffuse white 
      matter abnormalities. These findings indicate that prolonged administration of AME 
      and/or other contaminating polyenes injures human white matter. Long-term animal 
      studies, with particular attention to nervous system histology, must precede human 
      use of other polyene derivatives.

PG  - 332-337
LID - 10.1038/s41586-019-1195-2 [doi]
AB  - Alzheimer's disease is a pervasive neurodegenerative disorder, the molecular 
      complexity of which remains poorly understood. Here, we analysed 80,660 
      single-nucleus transcriptomes from the prefrontal cortex of 48 individuals with 
      varying degrees of Alzheimer's disease pathology. Across six major brain cell types, 
      we identified transcriptionally distinct subpopulations, including those associated 
      with pathology and characterized by regulators of myelination, inflammation, and 
      neuron survival. The strongest disease-associated changes appeared early in 
      pathological progression and were highly cell-type specific, whereas genes 
      upregulated at late stages were common across cell types and primarily involved in 
      the global stress response. Notably, we found that female cells were overrepresented 
      in disease-associated subpopulations, and that transcriptional responses were 
      substantially different between sexes in several cell types, including 
      oligodendrocytes. Overall, myelination-related processes were recurrently perturbed 
      in multiple cell types, suggesting that myelination has a key role in Alzheimer's 
      disease pathophysiology. Our single-cell transcriptomic resource provides a 
      blueprint for interrogating the molecular and cellular basis of Alzheimer's disease.

TI  - Widespread distribution of PLTP in human CNS: evidence for PLTP synthesis by glia 
      and neurons, and increased levels in Alzheimer's disease.
PG  - 1113-23
AB  - Plasma phospholipid transfer protein (PLTP) is one of the key proteins in lipid and 
      lipoprotein metabolism. We examined PLTP distribution in human brain using PLTP mRNA 
      dot-blot, Northern blot, immunohistochemistry (IHC), Western blot, and phospholipid 
      transfer activity assay analyses. PLTP mRNA of 1.8 kb was widely distributed in all 
      the examined regions of the central nervous system at either comparable or slightly 
      lower levels than in the other major organs, depending on the region. Cerebrospinal 
      fluid phospholipid transfer activity represented 15% of the plasma activity, 
      indicating active PLTP synthesis in the brain. Western blot and phosholipid transfer 
      activity assay demonstrated secretion of active PLTP by neurons, microglia, and 
      astrocytes in culture. IHC demonstrated PLTP presence in neurons, astrocytes, 
      microglia, and oligodendroglia. Some neuronal groups, such as nucleus hypoglossus 
      and CA2 neurons in hippocampus, ependymal layer, and choroid plexus were 
      particularly strongly stained, with substantial glial and neuropil immunostaining 
      throughout the brain. Comparison between brain tissues from patients with 
      Alzheimer's disease (AD) and nonAD subjects revealed a significant increase (P = 
      0.02) in PLTP levels in brain tissue homogenates and increased PLTP immunostaining 
      in AD.

TI  - Nerve cell loss in the thalamic centromedian-parafascicular complex in patients with 
      Huntington's disease.
PG  - 161-8
AB  - The centromedian-parafascicular complex represents a nodal point in the neuronal 
      loop comprising striatum--globulus pallidus--thalamus--striatum. Striatal neurone 
      degeneration is a hallmark in Huntington's disease and we were interested in 
      estimating total neurone and glial number in this thalamic nuclear complex. Serial 
      500-microns-thick gallocyanin-stained frontal sections of the left hemisphere from 
      six cases of Huntington's disease patients (three females, three males) and six age- 
      and sex-matched controls were investigated applying Cavalieri's principle and the 
      optical disector. Mean neurone number in the controls was 646,952 +/- 129,668 cells 
      versus 291,763 +/- 60,122 in Huntington's disease patients (Mann-Whitney U-test, P < 
      0.001). Total glial cell number (astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, microglia, and 
      unclassifiable glial profiles) was higher in controls with 9,544,191 +/- 3,028,944 
      versus 6,961,989 +/- 2,241,543 in Huntington's disease patients (Mann-Whitney 
      U-test, P < 0.021). Considerable increase of fibrous astroglia within the 
      centromedian-parafascicular complex could be observed after Gallyas' impregnation. 
      Most probably this cell type enhanced the numerical ratio between glial number and 
      neurone number (glial index: Huntington's disease patients = 24.4 +/- 8.1; controls 
      = 15.0 +/- 5.2; Mann-Whitney U-test, P < 0.013). The neurone number in the 
      centromedian-parafascicular complex correlated negatively, although statistically 
      not significantly, with the striatal neurone number. This lack of correlation 
      between an 80% neuronal loss in the striatum and a 55% neurone loss in the 
      centromedian-parafascicular complex points to viable neuronal circuits connecting 
      the centromedian-parafascicular complex with cortical and subcortical regions that 
      are less affected in Huntington's disease.

TI  - Atrophy of the hypothalamic lateral tuberal nucleus in Huntington's disease.
PG  - 371-82
AB  - The hypothalamic lateral tuberal nucleus (NTL) was studied in the formalin-fixed 
      brains of five patients with Huntington's disease (HD) and in five age- and 
      sex-matched controls. With the Klüver-Barrera (luxol fast blue/cresyl violet) and 
      hematoxylin and eosin stains the NTL was defined by its cytoarchitectonic 
      characteristics. The nucleus was composed of one type of neuron and had about 60,000 
      cells. In HD, up to 90% neuronal loss was found in the NTL. The remaining neurons 
      showed features of degeneration and there was astrocytosis. The estimated total 
      number of glial cells in the NTL was reduced to 80% of the control values, which was 
      exclusively accounted for by a reduction of 40% in the number of oligodendrocytes. 
      The total number of astrocytes was unchanged. Grouping of astrocytes and the changes 
      observed in glial fibrillary acidic protein immunocytochemistry suggested that 
      astrocytic proliferation occurred.

TI  - Fine-structural and degenerative features in adult and aged human sympathetic 
      ganglion cells.
PG  - 161-75
AB  - Sympathetic ganglia, either cervical and upper thoracic or lumbar, were removed from 
      adult and aged patients suffering from circulatory deficiencies in their upper or 
      lower extremities, respectively. The ganglion cells had several features that can be 
      associated with age. Lipofuscin was ample in all ganglion cells and was usually 
      polarly concentrated. Its amount tended to increase with age and it was present also 
      in the glial cells. Lipofuscin autofluorescence often prevented the visualization of 
      the formaldehyde induced fluorescence for catecholamines. At the electron 
      microscopic level, pigment bodies were seen to be composed of three different kinds 
      of osmiophilic properties: (1) gray component that had (2) dark patches dispersed 
      into it and (3) pale, oval, incorporated droplets. In principal ganglion cells, the 
      first two formed the major part, the pale one taking over in the small 
      granule-containing cells. Various inclusion bodies included a cylinder-shaped type 
      that had a varying pattern of rod-like structures inside it. Myelin figures (laminar 
      bodies) were sometimes found to fill neurite profiles, occasionally with random 
      mitochondrial accumulations. These bore a distant resemblance to the primitive type 
      of neuritic (senile) plaques, although none of the patients was diagnosed to have, 
      for example, Alzheimer's disease or senile dementia of the Alzheimer type. 
      Nevertheless, it appears to us that it might be possible to find coexistent 
      neuropathological changes in peripheral sympathetic ganglia in diseases affecting 
      primarily the central nervous system.

TI  - PTEN levels in Alzheimer's disease medial temporal cortex.
PG  - 114-23
AB  - Phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted from chromosome 10 (PTEN) is a dual 
      (protein tyrosine and lipid) phosphatase one of the functions of which is to 
      dephosphorylate phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate to 
      phosphatidylinositol-3,4-biphosphate thereby inhibiting phosphoinositide-dependent 
      kinase activation of the cell survival kinase Akt. Akt activity is up regulated in 
      Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain in parallel to the progression of neurofibrillary 
      pathology. The present study determined whether altered expression of PTEN occurs in 
      Alzheimer's disease brain. Western immunoblotting revealed no significant changes of 
      PTEN protein levels in nuclear and membrane fractions of medial temporal cortex from 
      a series of Alzheimer's disease and control cases. Similarly, no changes in PTEN 
      protein levels, as determined by dot-blotting, were seen in temporal cortex 
      homogenates from a separate series of Alzheimer's disease and control brains. A 
      small but significant decrease in the levels of Ser(380) p-PTEN was seen in 
      homogenates of Alzheimer's disease temporal cortex. Immunohistochemistry revealed 
      PTEN immunoreactivity in a number of brain structures including neurons, capillaries 
      and structures resembling oligodendrocytes and astrocytes. The majority of temporal 
      cortex pyramidal neurons (93-100%) were PTEN immunopositive. The Alzheimer's disease 
      cases had significantly lower numbers of total ( approximately 12% loss, P<0.02) and 
      PTEN immunopositive ( approximately 15% loss, P<0.01) pyramidal neurons as compared 
      to the control cases.

LID - 10.1016/j.brainres.2017.12.012 [doi]
AB  - α-Synuclein (α-SYN), a presynaptic protein with the tendency to aggregate, is linked 
      to α-synucleinopathies such as Parkinson's disease (PD), dementia with Lewy bodies 
      (DLB), and multiple system atrophy (MSA). α-SYN is the main component of round 
      intracytoplasmic inclusions called Lewy bodies (LBs), which are the hallmark of PD 
      and DLB. In addition, accumulation of amyloid-β and neurofibrillary tangles as in 
      the pathology of Alzheimer's disease has been found in the DLB brain. Glial 
      cytoplasmic inclusions are an MSA-specific type of inclusion found in 
      oligodendrocytes and mainly comprise α-SYN. FK506-binding protein (FKBP) 12 is a 
      member of the immunophilin family with peptidyl-prolyl isomerase activity that 
      promotes protein folding and is believed to act as a chaperone protein. Previous in 
      vitro work indicated that FKBP12 accelerated α-SYN aggregation more than other 
      peptidyl-prolyl isomerases. The enzymatic activity of FKBP12 increases the formation 
      of α-SYN fibrils at subnanomolar concentrations. In this study, we found that FKBP12 
      colocalized with α-SYN in LBs and neurites in PD and DLB brains. Furthermore, 
      FKBP12-immunopositive neurofibrillary tangles colocalized with phosphorylated tau in 
      DLB and FKBP12-immunopositive glial cytoplasmic inclusions colocalized with α-SYN in 
      MSA. These findings suggest that FKBP12 is linked to the accumulation of α-SYN and 
      phosphorylated tau protein in α-synucleinopathies. FKBP12 may play important roles 
      in the pathogenesis of α-synucleinopathies through its strong aggregation function. 
      Thus, FKBP12 could be an important drug target for α-synucleinopathies.

TI  - NG2 cells, a new trail for Alzheimer's disease mechanisms?
PG  - 7
LID - 10.1186/2051-5960-1-7 [doi]
LID - 7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Neuron Glial 2 (NG2) cells are glial cells known to serve as 
      oligodendrocyte progenitors as well as modulators of the neuronal network. Altered 
      NG2 cell morphology and up-regulation as well as increased shedding of the 
      proteoglycan NG2 expressed on the cell surface have been described in rodent models 
      of brain injury. Here we describe alterations in the human NG2 cell population in 
      response to pathological changes characteristic of Alzheimer's disease (AD). 
      RESULTS: Immunohistological stainings of postmortem brain specimens from clinically 
      diagnosed and postmortem verified AD patients and non-demented controls revealed 
      reduced NG2 immunoreactivity as well as large numbers of NG2 positive astrocytes in 
      individuals with high amyloid beta plaque load. Since fibrillar amyloid beta 
      (Aβ)1-42 is the major component of AD-related senile plaques, we exposed human NG2 
      cells to oligomer- and fibril enriched preparations of Aβ1-42. We found that both 
      oligomeric and fibrillar Aβ1-42 induced changes in NG2 cell morphology. Further, in 
      vitro exposure to fibrillar Aβ1-42 decreased the NG2 concentrations in both cell 
      lysates and supernatants. Interestingly, we also found significantly decreased 
      levels of soluble NG2 in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from clinically diagnosed AD 
      patients compared to non-demented individuals. Additionally, the CSF NG2 levels were 
      found to significantly correlate with the core AD biomarkers Aß1-42, T-tau and 
      P-tau. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate major alterations in the NG2 cell 
      population in relation to AD pathology which highlights the NG2 cell population as a 
      new attractive research target in the search for cellular mechanisms associated with 
      AD pathogenesis.

TI  - Isolation of neural precursor cells from Alzheimer's disease and aged control 
      postmortem brain.
PG  - 909-17
AB  - Recent studies demonstrate that isolated neural precursor cells are capable of 
      generating neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes from neurogenic regions of 
      adult brain. Because these studies use surgically resected or fresh postmortem 
      specimens from young subjects, it is not clear whether neural precursor cells remain 
      in the brain of normal aged subjects or subjects with Alzheimer's disease (AD). The 
      purpose of this study was to determine if viable precursor cells remain in aged 
      control and AD brain. AD subjects have significantly fewer viable precursor cells in 
      the hippocampus compared with age-matched normal control subjects. Musashi-1 and 
      Ki-67-positive precursor cells from AD self renew, but reach senescence earlier than 
      cells isolated from normal aged control subjects. Precursor cells from AD and aged 
      normal control specimens can differentiate into tubulin- and Tuj-1-positive neurons 
      and GFAP-positive astrocytes. This study demonstrates that viable precursor cells 
      remain in AD and aged normal control brain specimens and can be induced to 
      differentiate. These results raise the possibility of stimulation of inherent 
      precursor cells of aged individuals or AD patients to replace neurons lost in aging 
      and/or neurodegeneration.

TI  - Mutations modifying sporadic Alzheimer's disease age of onset.
PG  - 1116-1130
LID - 10.1002/ajmg.b.32493 [doi]
AB  - The identification of mutations modifying the age of onset (AOO) in Alzheimer's 
      disease (AD) is crucial for understanding the natural history of AD and, therefore, 
      for early interventions. Patients with sporadic AD (sAD) from a genetic isolate in 
      the extremes of the AOO distribution were whole-exome genotyped. Single- and 
      multi-locus linear mixed-effects models were used to identify functional variants 
      modifying AOO. A posteriori enrichment and bioinformatic analyses were applied to 
      evaluate the non-random clustering of the associate variants to physiopathological 
      pathways involved in AD. We identified more than 20 pathogenic, genome-wide 
      statistically significant mutations of major modifier effect on the AOO. These 
      variants are harbored in genes implicated in neuron apoptosis, neurogenesis, 
      inflammatory processes linked to AD, oligodendrocyte differentiation, and memory 
      processes. This set of new genes harboring these mutations could be of importance 
      for prediction, follow-up and eventually as therapeutical targets of AD. © 2016

TI  - Early postnatal behavioral, cellular, and molecular changes in models of Huntington 
      disease are reversible by HDAC inhibition.
PG  - E8765-E8774
LID - 10.1073/pnas.1807962115 [doi]
AB  - Huntington disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder caused 
      by expanded CAG repeats in the huntingtin gene (HTT). Although mutant HTT is 
      expressed during embryonic development and throughout life, clinical HD usually 
      manifests later in adulthood. A number of studies document neurodevelopmental 
      changes associated with mutant HTT, but whether these are reversible under therapy 
      remains unclear. Here, we identify very early behavioral, molecular, and cellular 
      changes in preweaning transgenic HD rats and mice. Reduced ultrasonic vocalization, 
      loss of prepulse inhibition, and increased risk taking are accompanied by 
      disturbances of dopaminergic regulation in vivo, reduced neuronal differentiation 
      capacity in subventricular zone stem/progenitor cells, and impaired neuronal and 
      oligodendrocyte differentiation of mouse embryo-derived neural stem cells in vitro. 
      Interventional treatment of this early phenotype with the histone deacetylase 
      inhibitor (HDACi) LBH589 led to significant improvement in behavioral changes and 
      markers of dopaminergic neurotransmission and complete reversal of aberrant neuronal 
      differentiation in vitro and in vivo. Our data support the notion that 
      neurodevelopmental changes contribute to the prodromal phase of HD and that early, 
      presymptomatic intervention using HDACi may represent a promising novel treatment 
      approach for HD.

AB  - A 34-year-old woman was initially seen because of a progressive neurological 
      disorder suggestive of a spinocerebellar degeneration. This condition had a late 
      infantile onset and was unassociated with visual impairment or dementia. Nerve 
      conduction velocity was severely reduced. A left hemiparesis later developed. A 
      computed tomographic scan revealed multiple periventricular hypodense lesions, 
      suggestive of a leukodystrophy. Sural nerve biopsy demonstrated changes of a chronic 
      demyelinating neuropathy, with inclusions typical of Krabbe's disease. This 
      diagnosis was confirmed by the finding of reduced leukocyte galactocerebrosidase 
      activity.

AB  - Huntington disease (HD), an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder caused by 
      an abnormal expansion of CAG trinucleotide repeat in the Huntingtin (HTT) gene, is 
      characterized by extensive neurodegeneration of striatum and cortex and severe 
      diffuse atrophy at MRI. The expression of genes involved in the cholesterol 
      biosynthetic pathway and the amount of cholesterol, lanosterol, lathosterol and 
      24S-hydroxycholesterol were reduced in murine models of HD. In case of HD-patients, 
      the decrease of plasma 24OHC follows disease progression proportionally to motor and 
      neuropsychiatric dysfunction and MRI brain atrophy, together with lanosterol and 
      lathosterol (markers of cholesterol synthesis), and 27-hydroxycholesterol. A 
      significant reduction of total plasma cholesterol was observed only in advanced 
      stages. It is likely that mutant HTT decreases the maturation of SREBP and the 
      up-regulation LXR and LXR-targeted genes (SREBP, ABCG1 and ABCG4, HMGCoA reductase, 
      ApoE) resulting into a lower synthesis and transport of cholesterol from astrocytes 
      to neurons via ApoE. In primary oligodendrocytes, mutant HTT inhibited the 
      regulatory effect of PGC1α on cholesterol metabolism and on the expression of MBP. 
      HTT seems to play a regulatory role in lipid metabolism. The impairment of the 
      cholesterol metabolism was found to be proportional to the CAG repeat length and to 
      the load of mutant HTT. A dysregulation on PGC1α and mitochondria dysfunction may be 
      involved in an overall reduction of acetyl-CoA and ATP synthesis, contributing to 
      the cerebral and whole body cholesterol impairment. This article is part of a 
      Special Issue entitled Brain Lipids.

TI  - rAAV-based brain slice culture models of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease 
      inclusion pathologies.
PG  - 539-555
LID - 10.1084/jem.20182184 [doi]
AB  - It has been challenging to produce ex vivo models of the inclusion pathologies that 
      are hallmark pathologies of many neurodegenerative diseases. Using three-dimensional 
      mouse brain slice cultures (BSCs), we have developed a paradigm that rapidly and 
      robustly recapitulates mature neurofibrillary inclusion and Lewy body formation 
      found in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, respectively. This was achieved by 
      transducing the BSCs with recombinant adeno-associated viruses (rAAVs) that express 
      α-synuclein or variants of tau. Notably, the tauopathy BSC model enables screening 
      of small molecule therapeutics and tracking of neurodegeneration. More generally, 
      the rAAV BSC "toolkit" enables efficient transduction and transgene expression from 
      neurons, microglia, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes, alone or in combination, with 
      transgene expression lasting for many months. These rAAV-based BSC models provide a 
      cost-effective and facile alternative to in vivo studies, and in the future can 
      become a widely adopted methodology to explore physiological and pathological 
      mechanisms related to brain function and dysfunction.

TI  - Cellular localization of human herpesvirus-6 in the brains of children with AIDS 
      encephalopathy.
PG  - 30-9
AB  - Human herpesvirus-6, the etiologic agent of exanthem subitum, is a ubiquitous virus 
      that infects almost all children by the age of 2 years and that has previously been 
      shown to be neuroinvasive. These characteristics suggest that human herpesvirus-6 
      may be important in the neuropathogenesis of acquired immune deficiency syndrome 
      (AIDS) in children. To address this hypothesis, we evaluated postmortem pediatric 
      brain tissues for the presence of human herpesvirus-6 infection. Using in situ 
      hybridization with a digoxigenin-labeled DNA probe for the large tegument protein 
      gene of human herpesvirus-6, we detected nuclear signals in postmortem brain tissue 
      from 4/5 children with human immunodeficiency virus-1 encephalitis. Human 
      herpesvirus-6 DNA was found in numerous oligodendrocytes of the white matter and 
      less frequently in astrocytes, macrophages, microglia and neurons. The human 
      herpesvirus-6 positive cells detected by in situ hybridization were not 
      immunoreactive either for human herpesvirus-6 early nuclear phosphoproteins or for 
      surface glycoproteins associated with productive infection. Only rare human 
      herpesvirus-6 infected cells were found in age-matched control brain tissues. No 
      human herpesvirus-6 infected cells were found in human fetal brain tissue. These 
      data suggest that human herpesvirus-6 is more extensively disseminated in neural 
      cells in the presence of human immunodeficiency infection and immunodeficiency in 
      pediatric AIDS patients, and it may contribute to the pathogenesis of AIDS 
      encephalopathy.

TI  - 'Unfolding' pathways in neurodegenerative disease.
PG  - 407-10
AB  - The endoplasmic reticulum responds to stress by initiating a cascade of events known 
      as the 'unfolded-protein response' (UPR). The accumulation of misfolded proteins in 
      the leukodystrophy Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease activates this stress response, 
      resulting in apoptosis of oligodendrocytes. Although it remains uncertain whether 
      the UPR plays a mechanistic role in prototypical neurodegenerative disorders such as 
      Alzheimer's disease, this is plausible because misfolded proteins are directly 
      implicated in the pathogenesis of these disorders.

AB  - Sulfatide (ST) is a sphingolipid with an important role in the central nervous 
      system as a major component of the myelin sheath. ST contains a structurally 
      variable ceramide moiety, with a fatty acid substituent of varying carbon-chain 
      length and double-bond number. Hydroxylation at the α-2 carbon position of the fatty 
      acid is found in half the population of ST molecules. Recent genetic studies of 
      fatty acid 2-hydroxylase (FA2H) indicate that these hydroxylated sphingolipids 
      influence myelin sheath stability. However, their distribution is unknown. 
      Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization imaging mass spectrometry (MALDI-IMS) 
      enables the analysis of distinct distributions of individual ST molecular species in 
      tissue section. We examined human cerebral cortex tissue sections with MALDI-IMS, 
      identifying and characterizing the distributions of 14 ST species. The distribution 
      analysis reveals that the composition ratios of non-hydroxylated/hydroxylated STs 
      are clearly reversed at the border between white and gray matter; the hydroxylated 
      group is the dominant ST species in the gray matter. These results suggest that 
      hydroxylated STs are highly expressed in oligodendrocytes in gray matter and might 
      form stable myelin sheaths. As a clinical application, we analyzed a brain with 
      Alzheimer's disease (AD) as a representative neurodegenerative disease. Although 
      previous studies of AD pathology have reported that the amount of total ST is 
      decreased in the cerebral cortex, as far as the compositional distributions of STs 
      are concerned, AD brains were similar to those in control brains. In conclusion, we 
      suggest that MALDI-IMS is a useful tool for analysis of the distributions of various 
      STs and this application might provide novel insight in the clinical study of 
      demyelinating diseases.

TI  - The HHV6 paradox: ubiquitous commensal or insidious pathogen? A two-step in situ PCR 
      approach.
PG  - 159-78
AB  - BACKGROUND: Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) and multiple sclerosis 
      (MS) are demyelinative diseases of the central nervous system (CNS). PML occurs 
      mostly in individuals with AIDS-impaired immunity and is thought to be caused by JC 
      polyoma virus (JCV). In MS a neurotrophic virus trigger is suspected, but the 
      precise etiology remains unknown. Human herpesvirus 6 (HHV6) is a ubiquitous, 
      commensal and usually benign beta-herpesvirus. Some researchers have found evidence 
      for HHV6 infection in MS plaques and sera. We recently demonstrated a high frequency 
      of cells containing HHV6 genome in PML lesions, as well as co-infection of 
      oligodendrocytes by JCV and HHV6. This suggests that HHV6 may be a co-factor in the 
      etiology of PML, and raises questions about its role in other demyelinative 
      diseases. OBJECTIVES: To determine the prevalence and cellular localization of HHV6, 
      JCV and HIV-1 infected cells in PML, MS, AIDS and control CNS tissues, and their 
      potential relationship with disease. STUDY DESIGN: An unconventional, sensitive 
      two-step in situ polymerase chain reaction (ISPCR) procedure was used to amplify and 
      detect HHV6, JCV and HIV-1 genomic DNAs in formalin fixed, paraffin-embedded 
      archival CNS tissues. HHV6, JCV and HIV-1 gene expression was detected by ICC for 
      HHV6 p41 and gp101, JCV large T, and HIV-1 p24 gag and NEF proteins. RESULTS: A high 
      frequency of HHV6 genome was consistently detected in both PML and MS white matter 
      lesional cells; a peri-lesional concentration was notable. HHV6 was found mainly in 
      oligodendrocytes, but neurons were also infected. HHV6 was present in larger amounts 
      than JCV in PML lesions, while more HIV-1 than HHV6 was present in AIDS. Variable 
      amounts of HHV6 genome were detected in normal, AIDS and other control brains; the 
      frequency of infected cells tended to increase with patient age. CONCLUSIONS: High 
      concentrations of HHV6 genome in association with PML and MS lesions, open the 
      possibility that HHV6 activation may play a role in the pathogenesis of these 
      demyelinative diseases.

TI  - A single-cell atlas of entorhinal cortex from individuals with Alzheimer's disease 
      reveals cell-type-specific gene expression regulation.
PG  - 2087-2097
LID - 10.1038/s41593-019-0539-4 [doi]
AB  - There is currently little information available about how individual cell types 
      contribute to Alzheimer's disease. Here we applied single-nucleus RNA sequencing to 
      entorhinal cortex samples from control and Alzheimer's disease brains (n = 6 per 
      group), yielding a total of 13,214 high-quality nuclei. We detail cell-type-specific 
      gene expression patterns, unveiling how transcriptional changes in specific cell 
      subpopulations are associated with Alzheimer's disease. We report that the 
      Alzheimer's disease risk gene APOE is specifically repressed in Alzheimer's disease 
      oligodendrocyte progenitor cells and astrocyte subpopulations and upregulated in an 
      Alzheimer's disease-specific microglial subopulation. Integrating transcription 
      factor regulatory modules with Alzheimer's disease risk loci revealed drivers of 
      cell-type-specific state transitions towards Alzheimer's disease. For example, 
      transcription factor EB, a master regulator of lysosomal function, regulates 
      multiple disease genes in a specific Alzheimer's disease astrocyte subpopulation. 
      These results provide insights into the coordinated control of Alzheimer's disease 
      risk genes and their cell-type-specific contribution to disease susceptibility. 
      These results are available at http://adsn.ddnetbio.com.

TI  - Defined astrocytic expression of human amyloid precursor protein in Tg2576 mouse 
      brain.
PG  - 393-403
LID - 10.1002/glia.23550 [doi]
AB  - Transgenic Tg2576 mice expressing human amyloid precursor protein (hAPP) with the 
      Swedish mutation are among the most frequently used animal models to study the 
      amyloid pathology related to Alzheimer's disease (AD). The transgene expression in 
      this model is considered to be neuron-specific. Using a novel hAPP-specific antibody 
      in combination with cell type-specific markers for double immunofluorescent 
      labelings and laser scanning microscopy, we here report that-in addition to neurons 
      throughout the brain-astrocytes in the corpus callosum and to a lesser extent in 
      neocortex express hAPP. This astrocytic hAPP expression is already detectable in 
      young Tg2576 mice before the onset of amyloid pathology and still present in aged 
      Tg2576 mice with robust amyloid pathology in neocortex, hippocampus, and corpus 
      callosum. Surprisingly, hAPP immunoreactivity in cortex is restricted to resting 
      astrocytes distant from amyloid plaques but absent from reactive astrocytes in close 
      proximity to amyloid plaques. In contrast, neither microglial cells nor 
      oligodendrocytes of young or aged Tg2576 mice display hAPP labeling. The astrocytic 
      expression of hAPP is substantiated by the analyses of hAPP mRNA and protein 
      expression in primary cultures derived from Tg2576 offspring. We conclude that 
      astrocytes, in particular in corpus callosum, may contribute to amyloid pathology in 
      Tg2576 mice and thus mimic this aspect of AD pathology.

TI  - [Pigmented form of orthochromatic leukodystrophy].
PG  - 1127-33
AB  - The pigmentary type of orthochromatic leukodystrophy (van Bogaert-Nyssen disease) is 
      a hardly known neurological disorder usually with late onset that is very difficult 
      to diagnose in vivo. Neuropathologically, the disorder features noninflammatory 
      demyelination and the presence of pigmented macrophages and astrocytes that may 
      contain iron. Clinically, van Bogaert-Nyssen disease can lead to death within a few 
      years and is characterized by dementia, psychiatric abnormalities, epileptic 
      seizures, spastic pareses, and occasionally extrapyramidal motor symptoms. This 
      report presents a typical case and an overview of the literature. Furthermore, 
      galactocerebroside could be documented in remaining macrophages and astrocytes by 
      immunohistochemistry. This possibly indicates a dysfunction in sphingolipid 
      breakdown and could relate the pigmented form of orthochromatic leukodystrophy to 
      the genetically defined globoid cell leukodystrophy (Krabbe's disease). Thus, the 
      rather heterogeneous pool of orthochromatic leukodystrophies could be further 
      narrowed.

TI  - Paranodal dissection in chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy with 
      anti-neurofascin-155 and anti-contactin-1 antibodies.
PG  - 465-473
LID - 10.1136/jnnp-2016-314895 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the morphological features of chronic inflammatory 
      demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) with autoantibodies directed against paranodal 
      junctional molecules, particularly focusing on the fine structures of the paranodes. 
      METHODS: We assessed sural nerve biopsy specimens obtained from 9 patients with CIDP 
      with anti-neurofascin-155 antibodies and 1 patient with anti-contactin-1 antibodies. 
      13 patients with CIDP without these antibodies were also examined to compare 
      pathological findings. RESULTS: Characteristic light and electron microscopy 
      findings in transverse sections from patients with anti-neurofascin-155 and 
      anti-contactin-1 antibodies indicated a slight reduction in myelinated fibre 
      density, with scattered myelin ovoids, and the absence of macrophage-mediated 
      demyelination or onion bulbs. Teased-fibre preparations revealed that segmental 
      demyelination tended to be found in patients with relatively higher frequencies of 
      axonal degeneration and was tandemly found at consecutive nodes of Ranvier in a 
      single fibre. Assessment of longitudinal sections by electron microscopy revealed 
      that detachment of terminal myelin loops from the axolemma was frequently found at 
      the paranode in patients with anti-neurofascin-155 and anti-contactin-1 
      antibody-positive CIDP compared with patients with antibody-negative CIDP. Patients 
      with anti-neurofascin-155 antibodies showed a positive correlation between the 
      frequencies of axo-glial detachment at the paranode and axonal degeneration, as 
      assessed by teased-fibre preparations (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Paranodal dissection 
      without classical macrophage-mediated demyelination is the characteristic feature of 
      patients with CIDP with autoantibodies to paranodal axo-glial junctional molecules.

TI  - Gene replacement therapy after neuropathy onset provides therapeutic benefit in a 
      model of CMT1X.
PG  - 3528-3542
LID - 10.1093/hmg/ddz199 [doi]
AB  - X-linked Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT1X), one of the commonest forms of 
      inherited demyelinating neuropathy, results from GJB1 gene mutations causing loss of 
      function of the gap junction protein connexin32 (Cx32). The aim of this study was to 
      examine whether delayed gene replacement therapy after the onset of peripheral 
      neuropathy can provide a therapeutic benefit in the Gjb1-null/Cx32 knockout model of 
      CMT1X. After delivery of the LV-Mpz.GJB1 lentiviral vector by a single lumbar 
      intrathecal injection into 6-month-old Gjb1-null mice, we confirmed expression of 
      Cx32 in lumbar roots and sciatic nerves correctly localized at the paranodal myelin 
      areas. Gjb1-null mice treated with LV-Mpz.GJB1 compared with LV-Mpz.Egfp (mock) 
      vector at the age of 6 months showed improved motor performance at 8 and 10 months. 
      Furthermore, treated mice showed increased sciatic nerve conduction velocities, 
      improvement of myelination and reduced inflammation in lumbar roots and peripheral 
      nerves at 10 months of age, along with enhanced quadriceps muscle innervation. 
      Plasma neurofilament light (NEFL) levels, a clinically relevant biomarker, were also 
      ameliorated in fully treated mice. Intrathecal gene delivery after the onset of 
      peripheral neuropathy offers a significant therapeutic benefit in this disease 
      model, providing a proof of principle for treating patients with CMT1X at different 
      ages.

TI  - Accumulation of a repulsive axonal guidance molecule RGMa in amyloid plaques: a 
      possible hallmark of regenerative failure in Alzheimer's disease brains.
PG  - 109-20
LID - 10.1111/j.1365-2990.2012.01281.x [doi]
AB  - AIMS: RGMa is a repulsive guidance molecule that induces the collapse of axonal 
      growth cones by interacting with the receptor neogenin in the central nervous system 
      during development. It remains unknown whether RGMa plays a role in the 
      neurodegenerative process of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We hypothesize that RGMa, if 
      it is concentrated on amyloid plaques, might contribute to a regenerative failure of 
      degenerating axons in AD brains. METHODS: By immunohistochemistry, we studied RGMa 
      and neogenin (NEO1) expression in the frontal cortex and the hippocampus of 6 AD and 
      12 control cases. The levels of RGMa expression were determined by qRT-PCR and 
      Western blot in cultured human astrocytes following exposure to cytokines and 
      amyloid beta (Aβ) peptides. RESULTS: In AD brains, an intense RGMa immunoreactivity 
      was identified on amyloid plaques and in the glial scar. In the control brains, the 
      glial scar and vascular foot processes of astrocytes expressed RGMa 
      immunoreactivity, while oligodendrocytes and microglia were negative for RGMa. In AD 
      brains, a small subset of amyloid plaques expressed a weak NEO1 immunoreactivity, 
      while some reactive astrocytes in both AD and control brains showed an intense NEO1 
      immunoreactivity. In human astrocytes, transforming growth factor beta-1 (TGFβ1 ), 
      Aβ 1-40 or Aβ 1-42 markedly elevated the levels of RGMa, and TGFβ1 also increased 
      its own levels. Coimmunoprecipitation analysis validated the molecular interaction 
      between RGMa and the C-terminal fragment β of amyloid beta precursor protein (APP). 
      Furthermore, recombinant RGMa protein interacted with amyloid plaques in situ. 
      CONCLUSIONS: RGMa, produced by TGFβ-activated astrocytes and accumulated in amyloid 
      plaques and the glial scar, could contribute to the regenerative failure of 
      degenerating axons in AD brains.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Pathological abnormalities including demyelination and neuronal loss are 
      reported in the outer cortex in multiple sclerosis (MS). OBJECTIVE: We investigated 
      for in vivo evidence of outer cortical abnormalities by measuring the magnetisation 
      transfer ratio (MTR) in MS patients of different subgroups. METHODS: Forty-four 
      relapsing-remitting (RR) (mean age 41.9 years, median Expanded Disability Status 
      Scale (EDSS) 2.0), 25 secondary progressive (SP) (54.1 years, EDSS 6.5) and 19 
      primary progressive (PP) (53.1 years, EDSS 6.0) MS patients and 35 healthy control 
      subjects (mean age 39.2 years) were studied. Three-dimensional (3D) 1×1×1mm(3) 
      T1-weighted images and MTR data were acquired. The cortex was segmented, then 
      subdivided into outer and inner bands, and MTR values were calculated for each band. 
      RESULTS: In a pairwise analysis, mean outer cortical MTR was lower than mean inner 
      cortical MTR in all MS groups and controls (p<0.001). Compared with controls, outer 
      cortical MTR was decreased in SPMS (p<0.001) and RRMS (p<0.01), but not PPMS. Outer 
      cortical MTR was lower in SPMS than PPMS (p<0.01) and RRMS (p<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: 
      Lower outer than inner cortical MTR in healthy controls may reflect differences in 
      myelin content. The lowest outer cortical MTR was seen in SPMS and is consistent 
      with more extensive outer cortical (including subpial) pathology, such as 
      demyelination and neuronal loss, as observed in post-mortem studies of SPMS 
      patients.

AB  - Glial reaction is a common feature of neurodegenerative diseases. Recent studies 
      have suggested that reactive astrocytes gain neurotoxic properties, but exactly how 
      reactive astrocytes contribute to neurotoxicity remains to be determined. Here, we 
      identify lipocalin 2 (lcn2) as an inducible factor that is secreted by reactive 
      astrocytes and that is selectively toxic to neurons. We show that lcn2 is induced in 
      reactive astrocytes in transgenic rats with neuronal expression of mutant human TAR 
      DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) or RNA-binding protein fused in sarcoma (FUS). 
      Therefore, lcn2 is induced in activated astrocytes in response to neurodegeneration, 
      but its induction is independent of TDP-43 or FUS expression in astrocytes. We found 
      that synthetic lcn2 is cytotoxic to primary neurons in a dose-dependent manner, but 
      is innocuous to astrocytes, microglia, and oligodendrocytes. Lcn2 toxicity is 
      increased in neurons that express a disease gene, such as mutant FUS or TDP-43. 
      Conditioned medium from rat brain slice cultures with neuronal expression of mutant 
      TDP-43 contains abundant lcn2 and is toxic to primary neurons as well as neurons in 
      cultured brain slice from WT rats. Partial depletion of lcn2 by immunoprecipitation 
      reduced conditioned medium-mediated neurotoxicity. Our data indicate that reactive 
      astrocytes secrete lcn2, which is a potent neurotoxic mediator.

TI  - Tau protein in the glial cytoplasmic inclusions of multiple system atrophy can be 
      distinguished from abnormal tau in Alzheimer's disease.
PG  - 49-52
AB  - The glial cytoplasmic inclusion (GCI) is a histological hallmark for multiple system 
      atrophy (MSA). These inclusions are in oligodendrocytes, contain microtubular 
      structures of 20-30 nm diameter, and can be labelled immunohistochemically with 
      antibodies to ubiquitin, alphaB-crystallin, alpha- and beta-tubulin, and the 
      microtubule-associated protein tau. GCIs have been compared with neuronal inclusions 
      in other neurodegenerative disorders including the neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) 
      found in Alzheimer's disease (AD), which also contain tau protein. In order to 
      determine whether the tau protein of GCIs in MSA is similar to that observed in AD 
      we used a panel of antibodies to phosphorylation-independent (SMI51, TP007, TP70), 
      dephosphorylation-dependent (Tau.1), and phosphorylation-dependent antibodies to tau 
      and neurofilaments (AT8, AT180, AT270, SMI31, SMI34, RT97, BF10, 8D8). 
      Immunohistochemistry was performed on paraffin wax-embedded brain tissue of the 
      cerebellum, brainstem, and frontal lobes (Brodmann areas 4/6) of ten clinically and 
      neuropathologically well-characterised cases of MSA, two cases of AD, and two normal 
      controls. The NFTs of the AD cases were labelled with all the 
      phosphorylation-dependent and phosphorylation-independent antibodies and with Tau.1 
      only after treatment with alkaline phosphatase. In contrast, GCIs were 
      immunolabelled by the phosphorylation-independent antibodies and Tau.1, but not by 
      the phosphorylation-dependent antibodies. These data demonstrate that the tau in 
      GCIs is different from the abnormally phosphorylated tau found in AD and is similar 
      to normal adult tau. The mechanism causing the abnormal accumulation of tau in GCIs 
      remains to be elucidated.

TI  - Elevated cerebrospinal fluid sulfatide concentrations as a sign of increased 
      metabolic turnover of myelin in HIV type I infection.
PG  - 149-55
AB  - Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) sulfatide concentrations were analyzed in 18 patients with 
      asymptomatic HIV-1 infection, in 16 patients with AIDS who were free from 
      opportunistic infections in the central nervous system (CNS), in 12 HIV-1-infected 
      patients with opportunistic CNS infections or lymphoma, and in 19 HIV-negative 
      controls, by thin-layer chromatography overlay technique using an antisulfatide 
      antibody to estimate the metabolic turnover of myelin. The majority of asymptomatic 
      HIV-1-infected patients had normal CSF sulfatide concentrations, but the mean CSF 
      sulfatide concentration was still elevated compared to that in HIV-negative controls 
      (152 compared to 99 nmol/liter, p < 0.05). The CSF sulfatide concentrations in the 
      AIDS group (mean 395 nmol/liter) were significantly increased compared to those in 
      asymptomatic HIV-1-infected patients (p < 0.01) and in HIV-negative controls (p < 
      0.001), but did not differ significantly between patients with and without dementia. 
      Increased CSF sulfatide concentrations were also found in patients with 
      opportunistic infection or lymphoma in the CNS. In the entire study population, the 
      sulfatide levels were associated with blood-brain barrier function, but not with 
      intrathecal immunoglobulin production or with positive HIV isolations from CSF. 
      Thus, signs of white matter changes, measured as increased CSF sulfatide 
      concentrations, could be found in some asymptomatic HIV-1-infected patients, but the 
      highest levels were seen in patients with AIDS.

AB  - Neuroglia, represented by astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, NG glia and microglia are 
      homeostatic, myelinating and defensive cells of the brain. Neuroglial cells express 
      various combinations of purinoceptors, which contribute to multiple intercellular 
      signalling pathways in the healthy and diseased nervous system. Neurological 
      diseases are invariably associated with profound neuroglial remodelling, which is 
      manifest by reactive gliosis, pathological remodelling and functional atrophy of 
      various types of glial cells. Gliopathology is disease and region specific and 
      produces multiple glial phenotypes that may be neuroprotective or neurotoxic. In 
      this review we summarise recent knowledge on the role of glial purinergic signalling 
      in cognitive-related neurological diseases. This article is part of the Special 
      Issue entitled 'Purines in Neurodegeneration and Neuroregeneration'.

AB  - Multiple system atrophy (MSA) is a rare and fatal neurodegenerative disorder that is 
      characterized by a variable combination of parkinsonism, cerebellar impairment, and 
      autonomic dysfunction. Some symptomatic treatments are available while 
      neuroprotection or disease-modification remain unmet treatment needs. The pathologic 
      hallmark is the accumulation of aggregated alpha-synuclein (α-syn) in 
      oligodendrocytes forming glial cytoplasmic inclusions, which qualifies MSA as 
      synucleinopathy together with Parkinson's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies. 
      Despite progress in our understanding of the pathogenesis of MSA, the origin of 
      α-syn aggregates in oligodendrocytes is still a matter of an ongoing debate. We 
      critically review here studies published in the field over the past 5 years dealing 
      with pathogenesis, genetics, clinical signs, biomarker for improving diagnostic 
      accuracy, and treatment development.

AB  - Tau protein in a hyperphosphorylated state makes up the intracellular inclusions of 
      several neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease and cases of 
      frontotemporal dementia. Mutations in Tau cause familial forms of frontotemporal 
      dementia, establishing that dysfunction of tau protein is sufficient to cause 
      neurodegeneration and dementia. Transgenic mice expressing human mutant tau in 
      neurons exhibit the essential features of tauopathies, including neurodegeneration 
      and abundant filaments composed of hyperphosphorylated tau. Here we show that a 
      previously described mouse line transgenic for human P301S tau exhibits an 
      age-related, layer-specific loss of superficial cortical neurons, similar to what 
      has been observed in human frontotemporal dementias. We also show that focal neural 
      precursor cell implantation, resulting in glial cell differentiation, leads to the 
      sustained rescue of cortical neurons. Together with evidence indicating that 
      astrocyte transplantation may be neuroprotective, our findings suggest a beneficial 
      role for glial cell-based repair in neurodegenerative diseases.

TI  - The enigma of cell death in neurodegenerative disorders.
PG  - 21-36
AB  - Progressive cell loss in specific neuronal populations is the pathological hallmark 
      of neurodegenerative diseases, but its mechanisms remain unresolved. Apoptotic cell 
      death has been implicated as a major mechanism in Alzheimer disease (AD), Parkinson 
      disease (PD) and other neurodegenerative disorders. However, DNA fragmentation in 
      human brain as a sign of neuronal cell injury is too frequent to account for the 
      continuous loss in these slowly progressive diseases. In a series of autopsy 
      confirmed cases of AD, PD, related disorders, and age-matched controls, DNA 
      fragmentation using the TUNEL method, an array of apoptosis-related proteins (ARP), 
      proto-oncogenes, and activated caspase-3, the key enzyme of late-stage apoptosis, 
      were examined. In AD, a considerable number of hippocampal neurons and glial cells 
      showed DNA fragmentation with a 3- to 6-fold increase related to neurofibrillary 
      tangles and amyloid deposits, but only 1 in 2.600 to 5.600 neurons displayed 
      apoptotic morphology and cytoplasmic immunoreactivity for activated caspase-3, 
      whereas no neurons were labeled in age-matched controls. caspase-3 immunoreactivity 
      was seen in granules of cells with granulovacuolar degeneration, in around 25% 
      co-localized with early cytoplasmic deposition of tau-protein. In progressive 
      supranuclear palsy, only single neurons and several oligodendrocytes in brainstem, 
      some with tau-deposits, were TUNEL-positive and expressed both ARPs and activated 
      caspase-3. In PD, dementia with Lewy bodies, multisystem atrophy (MSA), and 
      corticobasal degeneration, TUNEL-positivity and expression of ARPs or activated 
      caspase-3 were only seen in microglia and oligodendrocytes with cytoplasmic 
      inclusions, but not in neurons. These data provide evidence for extremely rare 
      apoptotic neuronal death in AD and PSP compatible with the progression of neuronal 
      degeneration in these chronic diseases. Apoptosis mainly involves reactive microglia 
      and oligodendroglia, the latter often involved by deposits of insoluble fibrillary 
      proteins, while alternative mechanisms of neuronal death may occur. Susceptible cell 
      populations in a proapoptotic environment show increased vulnerability towards 
      metabolic or other noxious factors, with autophagy as a possible protective 
      mechanism in early stages of programmed cell death. The intracellular cascade 
      leading to cell death still awaits elucidation.

AB  - A recent controlled trial has established that high-dose biotin supplementation - 
      100 mg, three times daily - has a stabilizing effect on progression of multiple 
      sclerosis (MS). Although this effect has been attributed to an optimization of 
      biotin's essential cofactor role in the brain, a case can be made that direct 
      stimulation of soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) by pharmacological concentrations of 
      biotin plays a key role in this regard. The utility of high-dose biotin in MS might 
      reflect an anti-inflammatory effect of cGMP on the cerebral microvasculature, as 
      well on oligodendrocyte differentiation and on Schwann cell production of 
      neurotrophic factors thought to have potential for managing MS. But biotin's ability 
      to boost cGMP synthesis in the brain may have broader neuroprotective potential. In 
      many types of neurons and neural cells, cGMP exerts neurotrophic-mimetic effects - 
      entailing activation of the PI3K-Akt and Ras-ERK pathways - that promote neuron 
      survival and plasticity. Hippocampal long term potentiation requires nitric oxide 
      synthesis, which in turn promotes an activating phosphorylation of CREB via a 
      pathway involving cGMP and protein kinase G (PKG). In Alzheimer's disease (AD), 
      amyloid beta suppresses this mechanism by inhibiting sGC activity; agents which 
      exert a countervailing effect by boosting cGMP levels tend to restore effective 
      long-term potentiation in rodent models of AD. Moreover, NO/cGMP suppresses amyloid 
      beta production within the brain by inhibiting expression of amyloid precursor 
      protein and BACE1. In conjunction with cGMP's ability to oppose neuron apoptosis, 
      these effects suggest that high-dose biotin might have potential for the prevention 
      and management of AD. cGMP also promotes neurogenesis, and may lessen stroke risk by 
      impeding atherogenesis and hypertrophic remodeling in the cerebral vasculature. The 
      neuroprotective potential of high-dose biotin likely could be boosted by concurrent 
      administration of brain-permeable phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors.

      with the use of histological and biochemical methods demonstrated a prevalence of 
      ischemic changes in the nervous cells, cells-shadows, demyelinization, fragmentation 
      of nervous filaments, hyperplasia, hypertrophy of astrocytes, a swelling of

TI  - A rare form of adult onset leukodystrophy: orthochromatic leukodystrophy with 
      pigmented glia.
PG  - 146-50
AB  - BACKGROUND: Orthochromatic leukodystrophy with pigmented glia and scavenger cells is 
      a rare leukodystrophy of unknown etiology. This report describes a 42-year-old man 
      with a history of depression, dementia and parkinsonism having the pathological 
      features of orthochromatic leukodystrophy with pigmented glia. METHODS: We reviewed 
      the clinical history and pathology of autopsy and brain biopsy material. RESULTS: 
      Imaging revealed bilateral cerebral white matter hypodensities. At autopsy, the 
      brain demonstrated a leukodystrophy affecting predominantly the cerebral hemispheres 
      and characterized by demyelination, and cytoplasmic pigment deposits in 
      oligodendroglia and astrocytes. The pigment had the staining properties of 
      ceroid-lipofuschin and on ultrastructural examination was composed of membrane-bound 
      lipid and electron-dense inclusions which had a fingerprint-like pattern. Similar 
      pigment inclusions were not observed on ultrastructural examination of renal, 
      splenic or hepatic tissue obtained at autopsy. The brain biopsy contained cerebral 
      cortex with sparse subcortical white matter in which a few oligodendroglia and fewer 
      astrocytes at the grey/white junctions showed cytoplasmic pigmentary inclusions 
      identical to those described above. However, due to the paucity of white matter in 
      the specimen a definite diagnosis of orthochromatic leukodystrophy with pigmented 
      glia was not made. CONCLUSIONS: The diagnosis of orthochromatic leukodystrophy with 
      pigmented glia and scavenger cells can only be made antemortem if the brain biopsy 
      contains adequate white matter and although a rare condition, it should be 
      considered in the differential diagnosis of an adult onset leukodystrophy.

TI  - [Cytokines and chemokines: mediators for intercellular communication in the brain].
PG  - 875-85
AB  - The brain includes glial cells (astrocytes, microglia and oligodendrocytes) and 
      endothelial cells in addition to neurons. Under some pathological conditions, it is 
      invaded by leukocytes such as neutrophils, monocytes/macrophages and lymphocytes. 
      Intercellular communication across these cell species is supposed to play crucial 
      roles both in the brain functions and dysfunctions. However, the molecular basis of 
      such intercellular communication remains unclear. We have studied the roles of 
      cytokines and chemokines, which have been investigated as essential mediators in the 
      immune and inflammatory systems, in intercellular communication across neurons, 
      glial cells, endothelial cells and leukocytes. Messenger RNA expression of cytokines 
      such as interleukin-1 beta was induced in brain microglia by i.p. injection of 
      excitotoxin and neurostimulant, at least, partly via catecholaminergic systems. 
      Messenger RNA of other cytokines such as leukemia inhibitory factor was induced in 
      astrocytes. This cytokine specifically induced nociceptin mRNA in the cultured 
      cortical neurons. Constitutive expression of some chemokines such as fractalkine and 
      stromal cell derived factor-1 alpha was observed in the brain, suggesting that they 
      play important roles in maintenance of brain homeostasis or determination of the 
      patterning of neurons and/or glial cells in the developing and adult brains. 
      Cytokines such as interleukin-1 beta and chemokines such as monocyte chemoattractant 
      protein-1 and macrophage inflammatory protein-1 alpha were produced in ischemic 
      brain and implicated in ischemic brain injury. In addition to ischemia, cytokines, 
      chemokines and their receptors have been shown to be involved in various 
      neurodegenerative diseases such as multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease and AIDS 
      dementia syndrome. They are potential targets for therapeutic intervention for 
      neurodegenerative diseases.

AB  - A 24-year-old man developed progressive dementia in seven years. The patient 
      suffered a severe bronchopneumonia and eventually died few days later. Brain coronal 
      sections showed a soft gray-brownish discoloration of white matter of centrum ovale 
      but the subcortical arcuate fibers and the interne capsule were preserved. 
      Microscopically, the white matter showed marked loss of myelin and oligodendrocytes, 
      abundant hypertrophic astrocytes and numerous "globoid cells". The latter showed 
      strong positivity in immunostains for a mouse monoclonal antigalactocerebroside 
      antibody. The presence of these cells in the brain white matter might be the 
      morphological basis to classify the present case as one of Krabbe's Leukodystrophy.

PG  - 787-92
AB  - We report the intra vitam histopathological findings on the brain of a female 
      patient presenting an adult form of orthochromatic leukodystrophy. At 38 years of 
      age the patient began to show progressive dementia and a pseudobulbar syndrome. The 
      pedigree revealed an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance. The CT scan showed a 
      wide hypodensity of the anterior white matter. Biochemical investigations showed 
      only a slight elevation of serum VLCFA and no alteration of urinary enzymatic 
      activities. Cortical and subcortical biopsy specimens from the right frontal lobe 
      showed: neuronal loss in the gray matter, accumulation of autofluorescent material 
      within residual neurons and sudanophilic material within macrophages and astrocytes, 
      sparing of axons. Electron microscopy showed lamination and fragmentation of the 
      myelin and the presence of electrondense bodies and vesicular material into 
      oligodendrocytes and astrocytes. We discuss the differential diagnosis of OLD forms 
      with adult onset, namely between Löwenberg-Hill disease and the pure form of OLD 
      with pigmented glial cells.

PG  - 267-77
LID - 10.1007/s00401-010-0712-z [doi]
AB  - A man aged 55 with negative family history presented with progressive decline in 
      spatial orientation and visual functions for 2 years. He showed impaired optic 
      fixation, optic ataxia, agraphia, acalculia, ideomotor apraxia, disturbed right-left 
      differentiation but preserved color matching, memory and motor perception, gradually 
      progressing to dementia, without extrapyramidal signs. Brain MRI and PET showed 
      severe bilateral atrophy and hypometabolism in parieto-occipital areas with sparing 
      of visual perception area and frontal lobes. Treatment with cholinesterase 
      inhibitors had no effect. Death occurred 6½ years after onset of symptoms from 
      bronchopneumonia. Clinical diagnosis was posterior cortical atrophy (Benson's 
      syndrome). Autopsy showed severe bilateral parietal cortical atrophy, less severe in 
      other brain regions without subcortical lesions. Histology revealed severe diffuse 
      tauopathy with neuronal loss, neurofibrillary tangles, neuropil threads, and tau 
      deposits in astroglia and oligodendroglia in parietal, temporal, occipital cortex, 
      less in frontal cortex and hippocampus, putamen, claustrum, thalamus and 
      subthalamus. Severely involved white matter showed many tau-positive threads, 
      comma-like inclusions in oligodendroglia (coiled bodies) and in astroglia. Mild 
      neuronal loss in substantia nigra was associated with massive tau pathology, also 
      involving several brainstem nuclei, cerebellum being preserved. There were neither 
      astrocytic plaques nor any amyloid pathology. Neuronal and glial inclusions were 
      generally 4R-tau-positive and 3R-tau-negative. No TDP-43 and α-synuclein inclusions 
      were detected. Spinal cord was not available. No mutations were found in the MAPT 
      gene. This is the first published case with the fully developed clinical and 
      neuroimaging picture of posterior cortical atrophy, morphologically presenting as a 
      distinct phenotype of 4R-tauopathy that closely resembles (atypical) CBD.

PG  - 81-9
AB  - Microglia, one of three types of glial cells in the central nervous system (CNS), 
      plays an important role as resident immunocompetent and phagocytic cells in CNS in 
      the event of injury and disease. It was del Rio Hortego who in 1927 determined that 
      microglia belong a distinct glial cell type apart from astrocytes and 
      oligodendrocytes. Since 1970s there has been wide recognition that microglial cells 
      are immune effectors in the CNS that respond to pathological conditions and 
      participate in initiation and progression of neurological disorders including 
      Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, and acquired immune 
      deficiency syndrome dementia complex by releasing potentially cytotoxic molecules 
      such as proinflammatory cytokine, reactive oxygen intermediates, proteinases and 
      complement proteins. There is also evidence to suggest that microglia is capable of 
      secreting neurotrophic or neuron survival factors upon activation during 
      inflammation or injury. It is thus timely to review the current status of knowledge 
      on origin, morphology and functional features of microglial cells.

TI  - Involvement of extrasynaptic glutamate in physiological and pathophysiological 
      changes of neuronal excitability.
PG  - 2917-2949
LID - 10.1007/s00018-018-2837-5 [doi]
AB  - Glutamate is the most abundant neurotransmitter of the central nervous system, as 
      the majority of neurons use glutamate as neurotransmitter. It is also well known 
      that this neurotransmitter is not restricted to synaptic clefts, but found in the 
      extrasynaptic regions as ambient glutamate. Extrasynaptic glutamate originates from 
      spillover of synaptic release, as well as from astrocytes and microglia. Its 
      concentration is magnitudes lower than in the synaptic cleft, but receptors 
      responding to it have higher affinity for it. Extrasynaptic glutamate receptors can 
      be found in neuronal somatodendritic location, on astroglia, oligodendrocytes or 
      microglia. Activation of them leads to changes of neuronal excitability with 
      different amplitude and kinetics. Extrasynaptic glutamate is taken up by neurons and 
      astrocytes mostly via EAAT transporters, and astrocytes, in turn metabolize it to 
      glutamine. Extrasynaptic glutamate is involved in several physiological phenomena of 
      the central nervous system. It regulates neuronal excitability and synaptic strength 
      by involving astroglia; contributing to learning and memory formation, 
      neurosecretory and neuromodulatory mechanisms, as well as sleep homeostasis.The 
      extrasynaptic glutamatergic system is affected in several brain pathologies related 
      to excitotoxicity, neurodegeneration or neuroinflammation. Being present in 
      dementias, neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric diseases or tumor invasion in a 
      seemingly uniform way, the system possibly provides a common component of their 
      pathogenesis. Although parts of the system are extensively discussed by several 
      recent reviews, in this review I attempt to summarize physiological actions of the 
      extrasynaptic glutamate on neuronal excitability and provide a brief insight to its 
      pathology for basic understanding of the topic.

TI  - White matter NMDA receptors: an unexpected new therapeutic target?
PG  - 561-6
AB  - Axons, their ensheathing myelin and supporting glia that make up the white matter in 
      the mammalian brain and spinal cord are fundamentally important for the normal 
      operation of the central nervous system. Prevalent human disorders such as stroke, 
      vascular dementia, multiple sclerosis, brain and spinal cord trauma, HIV-associated 
      dementia, periventricular leukomalacia of premature infants, and seemingly 
      traditional 'gray matter disorders' such as Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia, 
      exhibit white matter pathology that contributes to morbidity and mortality. 
      N-Methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors have been shown to have an important role in 
      mediating Ca2+-dependent injury of oligodendrocytes and the myelin sheath; newly 
      recognized family members of the NMDA receptor, known as NR3 subunits, seem to be 
      involved. Recently developed uncompetitive NMDA channel blockers such as memantine 
      hold therapeutic promise because these agents are well tolerated clinically and 
      might prove to be effective at protecting certain white matter elements from a 
      variety of insults.

TI  - [Kufs disease with leukoencephalopathy].
PG  - 392-7
AB  - We report a case of adult neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (Kufs' disease) with 
      leukoencephalopathy on cerebral scan CT and MRI. A 52 year-old woman presented with 
      partial complex epileptic seizure followed by progressive dementia, cerebellar 
      ataxia, pyramidal and akineto-rigid signs and symptoms. After 6 years of evolution, 
      cerebral stereotactic biopsies showed a diffuse gliosis of the white matter, but no 
      clear demyelination. Nerve and glial cells contained numerous PAS+ autofluorescent 
      granules. In the oligodendrocytes and astrocytes of the white matter these granules 
      appeared electronmicroscopically as cytoplasmic osmiophilic lamellar bodies with 
      fingerprint profile combined with some curvilinear and rectilinear aspects. The 
      cortical nerve cells contained granular osmiophilic bodies. This 
      "leukoencephalopathic" variant of Kufs' disease is probably related to the 
      pigmentary type of orthochromatic leukodystrophy, wherein similar inclusions have 
      been only described in the macrophages and glial cells of the white matter.

      and neuropathological findings].
PG  - 187-93
AB  - A 26-year-old man was first noticed to have slowly progressive difficulty in walking 
      and speaking at the age of 19 years. When he was 26 years old, a neurological 
      examination showed mild dementia, nystagmus, ataxic speech together with ataxic and 
      spastic gait. The T2-weighted MR images demonstrated increased signal areas with 
      sparing of small areas in the brain white matter. He expired suddenly at his age of 
      26 years. The neuropathological study revealed the mildly atrophic brain with 
      "tigroid" demyelination. Patchy demyelinated foci were found in the cerebellum, 
      brain stem and spinal cord. The myelin around blood vessels and axons were generally 
      well preserved. Oligodendrocytes were decreased in the demyelinated areas. A 
      diagnosis of classical Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease was neuropathologically made, in 
      spite of uncertainty of family history and late onset. Because MR images are 
      identical with the neuropathological findings of "tigroid pattern", MR imaging can 
      contribute to the clinical diagnosis of this disease. This is the first report in 
      which brain MR images are compared with neuropathological findings in a case of 
      classical P-M disease.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Aside from idiopathic Parkinson syndrome (Parkinson's disease), there 
      are a number of other, so-called atypical parkinsonian syndromes: dementia with Lewy 
      bodies (DLB), multiple system atrophy (MSA), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), 
      and corticobasal degeneration (CBD). DLB is a common disease, with a prevalence of 
      0.4% (400 cases per 100 000 persons) in the elderly; MSA and PSP both have a 
      prevalence of 5 to 10 per 100 000 persons, while the prevalence of CBD is about 1 
      per 100 000. METHODS: This review is based on pertinent publications retrieved by a 
      selective literature search. RESULTS: The atypical parkinsonian syndromes are 
      synucleinopathies and tauopathies, i.e., disorders characterized by the abnormal 
      deposition of the proteins α-synuclein and tau. The site of deposition is correlated 
      with the clinical features. In DLB, synuclein is mainly deposited in neocortical 
      neurons, with some brain stem involvement as well. The main clinical features are 
      dementia and, later on, parkinsonism. In MSA, synuclein is deposited in 
      oligodendrocytes, mainly in the cerebellum but also in the brain stem; the main 
      clinical feature is autonomic dysfunction combined with parkinsonism or cerebellar 
      ataxia. Synucleinopathies often impair REM (rapid eye movement) sleep. PSP and CBD, 
      on the other hand, are primary tauopathies. PSP usually causes predominantly 
      supranuclear vertical gaze palsy and early postural instability with falls, less 
      commonly parkinsonism (PSP-P) or frontotemporal dementia (PSP-FTD) as its most 
      prominent feature. CBD typically manifests itself as markedly asymmetrical 
      parkinsonism with apraxia or cortical sensory disturbance. At present, there is no 
      accepted causal treatment for any of these disorders; the available symptomatic 
      treatments are of limited efficacy and are supported only by low-level evidence. 
      CONCLUSION: Causal treatments for neurodegenerative diseases are now being developed 
      and tested, and thus a molecular diagnosis is desirable. This will require the 
      cooperation of primary care physicians with specialized centers.

TI  - Human adult neurogenesis across the ages: An immunohistochemical study.
PG  - 621-638
LID - 10.1111/nan.12337 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: Neurogenesis in the postnatal human brain occurs in two neurogenic niches; the 
      subventricular zone (SVZ) in the wall of the lateral ventricles and the subgranular 
      zone (SGZ) of the hippocampus. The extent to which this physiological process 
      continues into adulthood is an area of ongoing research. This study aimed to 
      characterize markers of cell proliferation and assess the efficacy of antibodies 
      used to identify neurogenesis in both neurogenic niches of the human brain. METHODS: 
      Cell proliferation and neurogenesis were simultaneously examined in the SVZ and SGZ 
      of 23 individuals aged 0.2-59 years, using immunohistochemistry and 
      immunofluorescence in combination with unbiased stereology. RESULTS: There was a 
      marked decline in proliferating cells in both neurogenic niches in early infancy 
      with levels reaching those seen in the adjacent parenchyma by 4 and 1 year of age, 
      in the SVZ and SGZ, respectively. Furthermore, the phenotype of these proliferating 
      cells in both niches changed with age. In infants, proliferating cells co-expressed 
      neural progenitor (epidermal growth factor receptor), immature neuronal 
      (doublecortin and beta III tubulin) and oligodendrocytic (Olig2) markers. However, 
      after 3 years of age, microglia were the only proliferating cells found in either 
      niche or in the adjacent parenchyma. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates a marked 
      decline in neurogenesis in both neurogenic niches in early childhood, and that the 
      sparse proliferating cells in the adult brain are largely microglia.

TI  - Sphingosine-1-Phosphate (S1P) and S1P Signaling Pathway: Therapeutic Targets in 
      Autoimmunity and Inflammation.
PG  - 1067-79
LID - 10.1007/s40265-016-0603-2 [doi]
AB  - Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) and S1P receptors (S1PR) are ubiquitously expressed. 
      S1P-S1PR signaling has been well characterized in immune trafficking and activation 
      in innate and adaptive immune systems. However, the full extent of its involvement 
      in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases is not well understood. FTY720 
      (fingolimod), a non-selective S1PR modulator, significantly decreased annualized 
      relapse rates in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (MS). FTY720, which 
      primarily targets S1P receptor 1 as a functional antagonist, arrests lymphocyte 
      egress from secondary lymphoid tissues and reduces neuroinflammation in the central 
      nervous system (CNS). Recent studies suggest that FTY720 also decreases astrogliosis 
      and promotes oligodendrocyte differentiation within the CNS and may have therapeutic 
      benefit to prevent brain atrophy. Since S1P signaling is involved in multiple immune 
      functions, therapies targeting S1P axis may be applicable to treat autoimmune 
      diseases other than MS. Currently, over a dozen selective S1PR and S1P pathway 
      modulators with potentially superior therapeutic efficacy and better side-effect 
      profiles are in the pipeline of drug development. Furthermore, newly characterized 
      molecules such as apolipoprotein M (ApoM) (S1P chaperon) and SPNS2 (S1P transporter) 
      are also potential targets for treatment of autoimmune diseases. Finally, the 
      application of therapies targeting S1P and S1P signaling pathways may be expanded to 
      treat several other immune-mediated disorders (such as post-infectious diseases, 
      post-stroke and post-stroke dementia) and inflammatory conditions beyond their 
      application in primary autoimmune diseases.

TI  - Lyme-associated parkinsonism: a neuropathologic case study and review of the 
      literature.
PG  - 1204-6
AB  - Neurological complications of Lyme disease include meningitis, encephalitis, 
      dementia, and, rarely, parkinsonism. We present a case of striatonigral 
      degeneration, a form of multiple system atrophy, in Lyme-associated parkinsonism. A 
      63-year-old man presented with erythema migrans rash, joint pains, and tremors. 
      Serum and cerebrospinal fluid antibodies and polymerase chain reaction for Borrelia 
      burgdorferi were positive. Clinical parkinsonism was diagnosed by several 
      neurologists. Despite treatment, the patient continued to decline, with progressive 
      disability, cognitive dysfunction, rigidity, and pulmonary failure. At autopsy, the 
      brain showed mild basal ganglia atrophy and substantia nigra depigmentation, with 
      extensive striatal and substantia nigral neuronal loss and astrogliosis. No Lewy 
      bodies were identified; however, ubiquitin-positive glial cytoplasmic inclusions 
      were identified in striatal and nigral oligodendroglia. There were no perivascular 
      or meningeal infiltrates, the classic findings of neuroborreliosis. To our 
      knowledge, this is the first report of striatonigral degeneration in a patient with 
      B burgdorferi infection of the central nervous system and clinical Lyme-associated 
      parkinsonism.

TI  - [Omega-3 fatty acids in psychiatry].
PG  - 216-21
AB  - The brain is one of the organs with the highest level of lipids (fats). Brain 
      lipids, formed of fatty acids, participate in the structure of membranes, for 
      instance 50 % fatty acids are polyunsaturated in the gray matter, 1/3 are of the 
      omega-3 family, and are thus of dietary origin. The omega-3 fatty acids (mainly 
      alpha-linolenic acid, ALA) participated in one of the first experimental 
      demonstration of the effect of dietary substances (nutrients) on the structure and 
      function of the brain. Experiments were first of all carried out on ex vivo cultured 
      brain cells, then on in vivo brain cells (neurons, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes) 
      from animals fed ALA deficient diet, finally on physicochemical (membrane fluidity), 
      biochemical, physiological, neurosensory (vision an auditory responses), and 
      behavioural or learning parameters. These findings indicated that the nature of 
      polyunsaturated fatty acids (in particular omega-3) present in formula milks for 
      human infants determines to a certain extend the visual, neurological, and 
      intellectual abilities. Thus, in view of these results and of the high 
      polyunsaturated fatty acid content of the brain, it is normal to consider that they 
      could be involved in psychiatric diseases and in the cognitive decline of ageing. 
      Omega-3 fatty acids appear effective in the prevention of stress, however their role 
      as regulator of mood is a matter for discussion. Indeed, they play a role in the 
      prevention of some disorders including depression (especially post partum), as well 
      as in dementia, particularly Alzheimer's disease. Their role in major depression and 
      bipolar disorder (manic-depressive disease), only poorly documented, is not clearly 
      demonstrated. The intervention of omega-3 in dyslexia, autism, and schizophrenia has 
      been suggested, but it does not necessarily infer a nutritional problems. The 
      respective importance of the vascular system (where the omega-3 are actually active) 
      and the cerebral parenchyma itself, remain to be resolved. However, the insufficient 
      supply of omega-3 fatty acids in today diet in occidental (less than 50 % of the 
      recommended dietary intakes values for ALA) raises the problem of how to correct 
      inadequate dietary habits, by prescribing mainly rapeseed (canola) and walnut oils 
      on the one hand, fatty fish (wild, or farmed, but the nature of fatty acids present 
      in fish flesh is the direct consequence of the nature of fats with which they have 
      been fed), and eggs from laying hens fed omega-3 fatty acids.

TI  - Characterization of chemokines and their receptors in the central nervous system: 
      physiopathological implications.
PG  - 1311-29
AB  - Chemokines represent key factors in the outburst of the immune response, by 
      activating and directing the leukocyte traffic, both in lymphopoiesis and in immune 
      surveillance. Neurobiologists took little interest in chemokines for many years, 
      until their link to acquired immune deficiency syndrome-associated dementia became 
      established, and thus their importance in this field has been neglected. 
      Nevertheless, the body of data on their expression and role in the CNS has grown in 
      the past few years, along with a new vision of brain as an immunologically competent 
      and active organ. A large number of chemokines and chemokine receptors are expressed 
      in neurons, astrocytes, microglia and oligodendrocytes, either constitutively or 
      induced by inflammatory mediators. They are involved in many neuropathological 
      processes in which an inflammatory state persists, as well as in brain tumor 
      progression and metastasis. Moreover, there is evidence for a crucial role of CNS 
      chemokines under physiological conditions, similar to well known functions in the 
      immune system, such as proliferation and developmental patterning, but also peculiar 
      to the CNS, such as regulation of neural transmission, plasticity and survival.

AB  - Comparison with existing methods. BACKGROUND: Neurodegenerative disorders affect a 
      large proportion of the elderly population. A group of disorders, known as the 
      α-synucleinopathies, are characterised by the presence of α-synuclein-containing 
      protein inclusions, such as Lewy Bodies (LBs) found in neurons from Parkinson's 
      Disease (PD) and Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB), and Glial Cytoplasmic Inclusions 
      (GCIs) found in oligodendrocytes from Multiple System Atrophy (MSA). The analysis of 
      the protein composition of inclusions has been hindered by limitations of methods 
      for isolating the inclusions from the surrounding tissue. METHOD: Four modifications 
      were made to the published method for GCI purification by Gai et al. (1999) which 
      were: collecting the entire inclusion-containing part of the Percoll gradient; lysis 
      of nuclei prior to DNAse digestion; limited tryptic digestion to release inclusions 
      from the cytoskeletal meshwork; and increased antibody and magnetic bead 
      concentrations/volumes to capture the larger amounts of inclusions. RESULTS: The 
      optimised method gave a 28-fold increase in yield compared to the published method 
      of Gai et al. (1999). A 2D-DIGE comparison revealed a 3.8-fold increase in 
      α-synuclein enrichment and a corresponding 5.2-fold reduction in tubulin 
      contamination. This method was also successfully adapted to the purification of LBs 
      from DLB tissue. A 2D-DIGE comparison of purified GCIs (n=2) revealed that GCIs 
      consist of 11.7% α-synuclein, 1.9% α-β-crystallin and 2.3% 14-3-3 proteins compared 
      to 8.5%, 2.0% and 1.5% in LBs, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: This study has generated 
      an improved method for the purification of α-synuclein-containing inclusions with a 
      yield sufficient for multiple forms of analysis.

TI  - The history of iron in the brain.
PG  - 1-9
AB  - Brain iron research began in the late nineteenth century when Zaleski (1886) made a 
      quantitative analysis of one human brain and correlated iron levels with 
      observations on stained slices and some microscopic sections. Gradually, the 
      realization grew that the central nervous system (CNS) contained iron which was 
      different from hemoglobin-iron. This non-heme iron was found in highest 
      concentrations in globus pallidus, substantia nigra, red nucleus, and dentate 
      nucleus. The enhancement of the traditional histochemical stain, potassium 
      ferrocyanide in hydrochloric acid, by incubating the reacted sections in a solution 
      of diaminobenzidine and hydrogen peroxide, revealed iron in many cell types of the 
      CNS, including neurons, microglia, oligodendroglia, and some astrocytes. A large 
      proportion of the soluble brain iron was shown to be present in ferritin. Brain 
      ferritin was found to be very similar to the protein from other organs in that it 
      contained heavy and light subunits. Several investigators reported the presence of 
      other iron-related proteins in the central nervous system, including transferrin, 
      transferrin receptor, and the ferritin repressor protein. Brain was shown to respond 
      to the extravasation of blood by converting the iron in heme to hemosiderin by a 
      sequence of steps which was quite similar to the process in extracerebral organs. 
      The methods of molecular biology have contributed greatly to our understanding of 
      brain iron but many questions remain about its unique anatomical distribution and 
      its role in degenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's 
      dementia.

TI  - Cockayne syndrome in adults: review with clinical and pathologic study of a new 
      case.
PG  - 991-1006
AB  - Cockayne syndrome and xeroderma pigmentosum-Cockayne syndrome complex are rare 
      autosomal recessive disorders with poorly understood biology. They are characterized 
      by profound postnatal brain and somatic growth failure and by degeneration of 
      multiple tissues resulting in cachexia, dementia, and premature aging. They result 
      in premature death, usually in childhood, exceptionally in adults. This study 
      compares the clinical course and pathology of a man with Cockayne syndrome group A 
      who died at age 31(1/2) years with 15 adequately documented other adults with 
      Cockayne syndrome and 5 with xeroderma pigmentosum-Cockayne syndrome complex. 
      Slowing of head and somatic growth was apparent before age 2 years, mental 
      retardation and slowly progressive spasticity at 4 years, ataxia and hearing loss at 
      9 years, visual impairment at 14 years, typical Cockayne facies at 17 years, and 
      cachexia and dementia in his twenties, with a retained outgoing personality. He 
      experienced several transient right and left hemipareses and two episodes of status 
      epilepticus following falls. Neuropathology disclosed profound microencephaly, 
      bilateral old subdural hematomas, white-matter atrophy, tigroid leukodystrophy with 
      string vessels, oligodendrocyte proliferation, bizarre reactive astrocytes, 
      multifocal dystrophic calcification that was most marked in the basal ganglia, 
      advanced atherosclerosis, mixed demyelinating and axonal neuropathy, and neurogenic 
      muscular atrophy. Cellular degeneration of the organ of Corti, spiral and vestibular 
      ganglia, and all chambers of the eye was severe. Rarely, and for unexplained 
      reasons, in some patients with Cockayne syndrome the course is slower than usual, 
      resulting in survival into adulthood. The profound dwarfing, failure of brain 
      growth, cachexia, selectivity of tissue degeneration, and poor correlation between 
      genotypes and phenotypes are not understood. Deficient repair of DNA can increase 
      vulnerability to oxidative stress and play a role in the premature aging, but why 
      patients with mutations in xeroderma pigmentosum genes present with the Cockayne 
      syndrome phenotype is still not known.

AB  - Microglia, one of three glial cell types in the central nervous system (CNS), play 
      an important role as resident immunocompetent and phagocytic cells in the CNS in the 
      event of injury and disease. It was del Rio Hortega in 1927 who determined that 
      microglia belong a distinct glial cell type apart from astrocytes and 
      oligodendrocytes, and since 1970s there has been wide recognition that microglia are 
      immune effectors in the CNS that respond to pathological conditions and participate 
      in initiation and progression of neurological disorders including Alzheimer's 
      disease, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, and acquired immune deficiency 
      syndrome dementia complex by releasing potentially cytotoxic molecules such as 
      proinflammatory cytokines, reactive oxygen intermediates, proteinases and complement 
      proteins. There is also evidence to suggest that microglia are capable of secreting 
      neurotrophic or neuron survival factors upon activation via inflammation or injury. 
      It is thus timely to review current status of knowledge on biology and immunology of 
      microglia, and consider new directions of investigation on microglia in health and 
      disease.

TI  - Two autopsy cases with Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease phenotype of adult onset, 
      without mutation of proteolipid protein gene.
PG  - 7-13
AB  - We report the autopsy cases of two brothers which are pathologically compatible with 
      Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease (PMD). Both patients had a late onset (at the ages of 
      29 and 42 years) and chronic neurological symptoms including tremor, ataxia and 
      dementia. The T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging of the younger brother 
      demonstrated increased signal areas with sparing of small areas in the cerebral 
      white matter. The postmortem examinations, obtained at the ages of 45 and 61 years, 
      showed similar neuropathological findings. Histologically, a cardinal finding was a 
      lack of myelin in large parts of white matter with the preservation of islands of 
      intact myelin, resulting in a "tigroid" appearance. Only small amounts of 
      sudanophilic material were present. The axons were relatively well preserved, but 
      oligodendrocytes were numerically reduced. Ultrastructurally, myelin sheaths in the 
      white matter were markedly thin. Immunohistochemistry showed that proteolipid 
      protein (PLP) was reduced in the affected white matter. However, genetic studies did 
      not reveal exonic mutations or duplications of the PLP gene. We conclude that the 
      two cases are a rare type of dysmyelinating disorder with PMD phenotype of adult 
      onset and could be caused by previously unrecognized abnormalities of the PLP gene 
      or other genes.

TI  - Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy: three patients diagnosed by brain 
      biopsy, with prolonged survival in two.
PG  - 407-14
AB  - Since 1980, three immunocompromised patients have been proved to have progressive 
      multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) by brain biopsy at the University of Alabama at 
      Birmingham. Two patients presented with focal neurological findings, and the third 
      presented with dementia. Computed tomography (CT) revealed white matter low density 
      lesions in areas appropriate to the neurological abnormalities. Brain biopsy of 
      areas that were abnormal on CT produced diagnostic tissue in all three patients. No 
      patient suffered ill effects from the biopsy. Neuropathological findings on light 
      microscopy were compatible with PML in each case, although there was diversity 
      within the group. Involvement of gray and white matter was present in all biopsy 
      specimens; oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, and neurons were affected. Electron 
      microscopic demonstration of particles compatible with polyoma virus confirmed the 
      diagnosis in each case. Immunosuppressive medication was discontinued in two of the 
      patients; these two have survived more than 2 years after diagnosis. One of these 
      two has gradually improved and is independent in simple activities of daily life. 
      Brain stem and cerebellar involvement and seizure disorders have been present in all 
      reported cases. PML can be accurately and rapidly diagnosed by brain biopsy, 
      enabling therapeutic manipulations that may prolong survival.

TI  - Dialysis-associated encephalopathy: light and electron microscopic morphology and 
      topography with evidence of aluminum by laser microprobe mass analysis.
PG  - 249-58
AB  - Recently we described silver-staining variants for the demonstration of beta/A4 
      amyloid and neurofibrillary tangles in senile dementia of Alzheimer type (SDAT). The 
      same methods allowed, for the first time, the visualization of characteristic 
      patterns and distinct morphological changes in human dialysis-associated 
      encephalopathy. Light and electron microscopy demonstrated typical silver-stained 
      inclusions in the cytoplasm of choroidal epithelium, glia and neurons. Performing 
      laser microprobe mass analysis on en-bloc silver-stained semithin sections, evidence 
      for significant amounts of aluminum was obtained within the lesions. Prominent 
      aluminum-signals were obtained additionally in adjacent structures and nuclei of 
      sections which were stained with toluidine-blue exclusively. Silver-stained paraffin 
      sections of ten patients with a history of long-term hemodialysis were evaluated. 
      The choroidal epithelium--obviously the most sensitive structure--showed black 
      inclusions ranging from a few dots to a complete black staining of cells. Glial 
      cells presented massive silver-stained deposits, which were restricted to the gray 
      matter. Finally, neurons revealed numerous fine-granular black inclusions, scattered 
      throughout the cytoplasm. Brain stem nuclei were primarily affected, but neurons 
      within cortex, subcortical gray matter and spinal cord were also involved to various 
      degrees; inclusions were not evident in the nucleus dentatus and the oliva inferior. 
      Vessel-related deposits were found frequently. By electron microscopy the cytoplasm 
      of neurons was filled either with large amounts of small electron-dense granules, or 
      with lipofuscin granules, containing numerous irregular, non-membrane-bound 
      inclusions. Massive electron-dense depositions were seen in the cytoplasm of 
      choroidal epithelia and in proximity to nuclei of cortical astro- and 
      oligodendroglia. The described neuronal changes and, in particular, alterations of 
      choroidal epithelium and glia are completely different from characteristic plaques 
      and tangles in SDAT.

TI  - A case of rapidly progressive multiple system degeneration: morphological findings 
      and pathogenetic implications.
PG  - 295-300
AB  - A 62-year-old woman was referred to our psychiatric hospital by the municipal health 
      office, because she was in such a neglected condition that she was a danger to 
      herself. Initially, it was suspected that she was suffering from dementia or 
      psychosis. X-rays led to the suspicion of bronchial carcinoma. Consequently, the 
      mental changes were interpreted as probable effects of metastases to the brain. 
      There was not enough time, however, to check the patient thoroughly to find the 
      actual cause of her altered personality. The patient developed a high fever (up to 
      42 degrees C). A few days later, she died of cardiorespiratory failure with severe 
      abscess-forming obstructive pneumonia. An autopsy confirmed the bronchial carcinoma. 
      However, metastases were only found in the hilar lymph nodes. No metastases were 
      detectable in the CNS, either macroscopically or microscopically. The 
      neuropathological examination of the brain revealed multiple system degeneration. 
      The striking microscopic findings (a large number of typical apoptotic figures 
      visible with the light microscope in ganglion cells, lack of cytoplasmic inclusion 
      bodies in the oligodendroglia and an unusually strong monocytic reaction (so-called 
      reactive satellitosis) indicated that the disease course had been very rapid. 
      Perhaps these were early steps in the evolution of a multisystem atrophy. A kind of 
      time-lapse effect, as it were, revealed simultaneously individual details of the 
      pathogenetic course, which would have disappeared in the usual long course of the 
      disease and thus could not have been observed, even with the most up-to-date 
      molecular methods. It is very likely that this was a paraneoplastic syndrome.

TI  - Lipid dysfunction and pathogenesis of multiple system atrophy.
PG  - 15
LID - 10.1186/2051-5960-2-15 [doi]
AB  - Multiple system atrophy (MSA) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease 
      characterized by the accumulation of α-synuclein protein in the cytoplasm of 
      oligodendrocytes, the myelin-producing support cells of the central nervous system 
      (CNS). The brain is the most lipid-rich organ in the body and disordered metabolism 
      of various lipid constituents is increasingly recognized as an important factor in 
      the pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative diseases. α-Synuclein is a 17 kDa 
      protein with a close association to lipid membranes and biosynthetic processes in 
      the CNS, yet its precise function is a matter of speculation, particularly in 
      oligodendrocytes. α-Synuclein aggregation in neurons is a well-characterized feature 
      of Parkinson's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies. Epidemiological evidence and 
      in vitro studies of α-synuclein molecular dynamics suggest that disordered lipid 
      homeostasis may play a role in the pathogenesis of α-synuclein aggregation. However, 
      MSA is distinct from other α-synucleinopathies in a number of respects, not least 
      the disparate cellular focus of α-synuclein pathology. The recent identification of 
      causal mutations and polymorphisms in COQ2, a gene encoding a biosynthetic enzyme 
      for the production of the lipid-soluble electron carrier coenzyme Q10 (ubiquinone), 
      puts membrane transporters as central to MSA pathogenesis, although how such 
      transporters are involved in the early myelin degeneration observed in MSA remains 
      unclear. The purpose of this review is to bring together available evidence to 
      explore the potential role of membrane transporters and lipid dyshomeostasis in the 
      pathogenesis of α-synuclein aggregation in MSA. We hypothesize that dysregulation of 
      the specialized lipid metabolism involved in myelin synthesis and maintenance by 
      oligodendrocytes underlies the unique neuropathology of MSA.

TI  - Chemokine receptors in the central nervous system: role in brain inflammation and 
      neurodegenerative diseases.
PG  - 16-42
AB  - Chemokines were originally described as chemotactic cytokines involved in leukocyte 
      trafficking. Research over the last decade, however, has shown that chemokine 
      receptors are not restricted to leukocytes. In the brain, chemokine receptors are 
      not only found in microglia (a brain macrophage), but also in astrocytes, 
      oligodendrocytes and neurons. In this review, we describe the spatial and cellular 
      distribution of chemokine receptors in the brain, distinguishing between 
      constitutively and inducibly expressed receptors. We then discuss possible 
      physiological functions, including neuronal migration, cell proliferation and 
      synaptic activity. Evidence is emerging that chemokine receptors are also involved 
      in neuronal death and hence neurodegenerative diseases. Chemokines may induce 
      neuronal death either indirectly (e.g. through activation of microglia killing 
      mechanisms) or directly through activation of neuronal chemokine receptors. Disease 
      processes in which chemokines and their receptors are likely to be involved include 
      multiple sclerosis (MS), Alzheimer's disease (AD), HIV-associated dementia (HAD) and 
      cerebral ischemic disease. The study of chemokines and their receptors in the 
      central nervous system (CNS) is not only relevant for the understanding of brain 
      physiology and pathophysiology, but may also lead to the development of targeted 
      treatments for neurodegenerative diseases.

PG  - 858-63
AB  - We report here a 55-year-old man with progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy 
      (PML) associated with chronic adult T cell leukemia (ATL). Neurological examination 
      revealed mild dementia, right homonymous hemianopsia and visual agnosia. 
      Serologically anti-HTLV-I antibody was positive. Peripheral blood analysis showed 
      ATL cells up to 23% in white blood cells. Because he did not have symptoms or signs 
      directly related to ATL, it was considered that he had chronic ATL. T2-weighted 
      cranial MRI demonstrated multiple hyperintensity lesions confined to the white 
      matter from the bilateral occipital to parietal lobes, without enhancement after 
      gadolinium administration or mass effect. We performed stereotactic biopsy of the 
      left occipitoparietal white matter. Histological examination of the biopsied 
      specimens showed demyelinated lesions, containing foamy macrophages and bizarre 
      astrocytes. Oligodendrocytes contained nuclear inclusions which reacted with an 
      antibody against the JC virus (JCV) antigen. These findings were consistent with 
      those of PML. The genomic analysis of JCV from the biopsied brain revealed deletions 
      in the regulatory region. We investigated cerebral blood flow, glucose and amino 
      acid metabolism in this patient using positron emission tomography, and obtained the 
      following three characteristic findings in the lesions: 1) luxury perfusion state, 
      2) decreased fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake, and 3) increased methionine (Met) 
      uptake. These findings resembled those of low grade tumors.

AB  - The extracellular matrix (ECM) is known to regulate important processes in neuronal 
      cell development, activity and growth. It is associated with the structural 
      stabilization of neuronal processes and synaptic contacts during the maturation of 
      the central nervous system. The remodeling of the ECM during both development and 
      after central nervous system injury has been shown to affect neuronal guidance, 
      synaptic plasticity and their regenerative responses. Particular interest has 
      focused on the inhibitory role of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs) and 
      their formation into dense lattice-like structures, termed perineuronal nets (PNNs), 
      which enwrap sub-populations of neurons and restrict plasticity. Recent studies in 
      mammalian systems have implicated CSPGs and PNNs in regulating and restricting 
      structural plasticity. The enzymatic degradation of CSPGs or destabilization of PNNs 
      has been shown to enhance neuronal activity and plasticity after central nervous 
      system injury. This review focuses on the role of the ECM, CSPGs and PNNs; and how 
      developmental and pharmacological manipulation of these structures have enhanced 
      neuronal plasticity and aided functional recovery in regeneration, stroke, and 
      amblyopia. In addition to CSPGs, this review also points to the functions and 
      potential therapeutic value of these and several other key ECM molecules in 
      epileptogenesis and dementia.

AB  - Autophagosomal formation is an initial step for macroautophagy. Similar to the yeast 
      autophagy-related gene 8 (ATG8), mammalian ATG8 is responsible for autophagosomal 
      formation, and categorized into LC3 and GABARAPs/GATE-16. Recent studies have shown 
      that impairment of the autophagy-lysosome system is associated with formation of 
      cytoplasmic inclusions observed in various neurodegenerative disorders including 
      Parkinson's disease (PD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). Although abnormal 
      α-synuclein accumulation is a cardinal neuropathological feature in PD, DLB and 
      multiple system atrophy (MSA), it is unclear whether autophagy is altered in MSA. We 
      here demonstrated that the level of matured GABARAPs was significantly decreased in 
      the cerebellum of MSA relative to controls, and that the higher levels of matured 
      and lipidated LC3 were detected in detergent-insoluble fraction of MSA. 
      Immunohistochemical analysis showed that the vast majority of glial cytoplasmic 
      inclusions, a hallmark of MSA, were positive for LC3, whereas they were unstained or 
      barely stained with anti-GABARAPs or anti-GATE-16 antibodies. Our data suggest that 
      autophagy maturation is impaired through the repressed levels of autophagosomal 
      proteins in MSA.

AB  - Multiple system atrophy (MSA) is a predominantly sporadic, adult-onset, fatal 
      neurodegenerative disease of unknown etiology. MSA is characterized by autonomic 
      failure, levodopa-unresponsive parkinsonism, cerebellar ataxia and pyramidal signs 
      in any combination. MSA belongs to a group of neurodegenerative disorders termed 
      α-synucleinopathies, which also include Parkinson's disease and dementia with Lewy 
      bodies. Their common pathological feature is the occurrence of abnormal α-synuclein 
      positive inclusions in neurons or glial cells. In MSA, the main cell type presenting 
      aggregates composed of α-synuclein are oligodendroglial cells . This pathological 
      hallmark, also called glial cytoplasmic inclusions (GCIs) , is associated with 
      progressive and profound neuronal loss in various regions of the brain. The 
      development of animal models of MSA is justified by the limited understanding of the 
      mechanisms of neurodegeneration and GCIs formation, which is paralleled by a lack of 
      therapeutic strategies. Two main types of rodent models have been generated to 
      replicate different features of MSA neuropathology. On one hand, neurotoxin-based 
      models have been produced to reproduce neuronal loss in substantia nigra pars 
      compacta and striatum. On the other hand, transgenic mouse models with 
      overexpression of α-synuclein in oligodendroglia have been used to reproduce 
      GCIs-related pathology. This chapter gives an overview of the atypical Parkinson's 
      syndrome MSA and summarizes the currently available MSA animal models and their 
      relevance for pre-clinical testing of disease-modifying therapies.

TI  - Primary Tau Pathology, Not Copathology, Correlates With Clinical Symptoms in PSP and 
      CBD.
PG  - 296-304
LID - 10.1093/jnen/nlz141 [doi]
AB  - Distinct neuronal and glial tau pathologies define corticobasal degeneration (CBD) 
      and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP). Additional Alzheimer disease, TDP-43, and 
      Lewy body copathologies are also common. The interplay of these pathologies with 
      clinical symptoms remains unclear as individuals can present with corticobasal 
      syndrome, frontotemporal dementia, PSP, or atypical Parkinsonism and may have 
      additional secondary impairments. We report clinical, pathological, and genetic 
      interactions in a cohort of CBD and PSP cases. Neurofibrillary tangles and plaques 
      were common. Apolipoprotein E (APOE)ε4 carriers had more plaques while PSP APOEε2 
      carriers had fewer plaques. TDP-43 copathology was present and age-associated in 14% 
      of PSP, and age-independent in 33% of CBD. Lewy body copathology varied from 9% to 
      15% and was not age-associated. The primary FTD-Tau burden-a sum of the neuronal, 
      astrocytic and oligodendrocytic tau-was not age-, APOE-, or MAPT-related. In PSP, 
      FTD-Tau, independent of copathology, associated with executive, language, motor, and 
      visuospatial impairments, while PSP with Parkinsonism had a lower FTD-Tau burden, 
      but this was not the case in CBD. Taken together, our results indicate that the 
      primary tauopathy burden is the strongest correlate of clinical PSP, while 
      copathologies are principally determined by age and genetic risk factors.

TI  - [The role of nutritional factors on the structure and function of the brain: an 
      update on dietary requirements].
PG  - 767-92
AB  - The brain is an organ elaborated and functioning from substances present in the 
      diet. Dietary regulation of blood glucose level (via ingestion of food with a low 
      glycemic index ensuring a low insulin level) improves the quality and duration of 
      intellectual performance, if only because at rest the adult brain consumes 50 p. 100 
      of dietary carbohydrates, 80 p. 100 of them for energy purposes. The nature of the 
      amino acid composition of dietary proteins contributes to good cerebral function; 
      tryptophan plays a special role. Many indispensable amino acids present in dietary 
      proteins help to elaborate neurotransmitters and neuromodulators. Omega-3 fatty 
      acids provided the first coherent experimental demonstration of the effect of 
      dietary nutrients on the structure and function of the brain. First it was shown 
      that the differentiation and functioning of cultured brain cells requires omega-3 
      fatty acids. It was then demonstrated that alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) deficiency 
      alters the course of brain development, perturbs the composition and physicochemical 
      properties of brain cell membranes, neurones, oligodendrocytes, and astrocytes 
      (ALA). This leads to physicochemical modifications, induces biochemical and 
      physiological perturbations, and results in neurosensory and behavioral upset. 
      Consequently, the nature of polyunsaturated fatty acids (in particular omega-3) 
      present in formula milks for infants (premature and term) conditions the visual and 
      cerebral abilities, including intellectual abilities. Moreover, dietary omega-3 
      fatty acids are certainly involved in the prevention of some aspects of 
      cardiovascular disease (including at the level of cerebral vascularization), and in 
      some neuropsychiatric disorders, particularly depression, as well as in dementia, 
      notably Alzheimer's disease. Their deficiency can prevent the satisfactory renewal 
      of membranes and thus accelerate cerebral aging. Iron is necessary to ensure 
      oxygenation, to produce energy in the cerebral parenchyma, and for the synthesis of 
      neurotransmitters. The iodine provided by the thyroid hormone ensures the energy 
      metabolism of the cerebral cells. The absence of iodine during pregnancy induces 
      severe cerebral dysfunction, leading to cretinism. Manganese, copper, and zinc 
      participate in enzymatic mechanisms that protect against free radicals, toxic 
      derivatives of oxygen. The use of glucose by nervous tissue implies the presence of 
      vitamin B1. Vitamin B9 preserves memory during aging, and with vitamin B12 delays 
      the onset of signs of dementia, provided it is administered in a precise clinical 
      window, at the onset of the first symptoms. Vitamins B6 and B12, among others, are 
      directly involved in the synthesis of neurotransmitters. Nerve endings contain the 
      highest concentrations of vitamin C in the human body. Among various vitamin E 
      components, only alpha-tocopherol is involved in nervous membranes. The objective of 
      this update is to give an overview of the effects of dietary nutrients on the 
      structure and certain functions of the brain.

LID - 10.2169/internalmedicine.55.6051 [doi]
AB  - A 53-year-old man was admitted for sub-acute progressive dementia and Gerstmann 
      syndrome. MRI demonstrated lesions in the white matter involving the left parietal 
      lobe, accompanied by speckled or faint linear peripheral enhancement. Brain biopsy 
      revealed JC virus infection in oligodendrocytes and balanced infiltration of CD8+ 
      and CD4+ T lymphocytes. We diagnosed progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy 
      (PML) with controlled inflammation. The finding of CD4/CD8 T cells in the infected 
      PML brain suggested therapeutically valuable immune system involvement, which we 
      decided to preserve by withholding corticosteroids. We treated the patient with 
      risperidone, cytarabine and mefloquine to suppress virus replication, but not with 
      the corticosteroid that is conventionally used in inflammatory PML cases. The 
      patient was discharged three months after admission, and one year later, his score 
      on the Mini-Mental State Examination had recovered to 26/30, from 5/30 on admission.

PG  - 7-15
AB  - Mutations in eukaryotic initiation factor 2B (eIF2B) cause one of the most common 
      leukodystrophies, childhood ataxia with CNS hypomyelination/vanishing white matter 
      disease or CACH/VWM. Patients may develop a wide spectrum of neurological 
      abnormalities from prenatal-onset white matter disease to juvenile or adult-onset 
      ataxia and dementia, sometimes with ovarian insufficiency. The pattern of diffuse 
      white matter abnormalities on MRI of the head is often diagnostic. Neuropathological 
      abnormalities indicate a unique and selective disruption of oligodendrocytes and 
      astrocytes with sparing of neurons. Marked decrease of asialo-transferrin in 
      cerebrospinal fluid is the only biochemical abnormality identified thus far. 
      Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2B (eIF2B) mutations cause a decrease in 
      guanine nucleotide exchange activity on eIF2-GDP, resulting in increased 
      susceptibility to stress and enhanced ATF4 expression during endoplasmic reticulum 
      stress. eIF2B mutations are speculated to lead to increased susceptibility to 
      various physiological stress conditions. Future research will be directed towards 
      understanding why abnormal control of protein translation predominantly affects 
      brain glial cells.

TI  - [Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy in the province of Cadiz, Spain].
PG  - 231-5
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), which is caused by 
      the reactivation of an infection due to the JC human polyoma virus, affects 
      immunocompromised patients and more especially those infected by the human 
      immunodeficiency virus. It produces a multifocal neurological clinical picture due 
      to the destruction of oligodendrocytes and the subsequent demyelination. AIMS: To 
      analyse the epidemiological, semiological and radiological characteristics of a 
      sample of patients diagnosed with PML in the province of Cadiz, and to study their 
      rates of survival. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Our sample consisted of 23 patients with 
      PML who presented an unfavourable immunological situation and deficient therapeutic 
      compliance. Factors studied included time to progression of the symptoms, clinical 
      features, neuroimaging and survival. RESULTS: The mean time elapsed between the 
      appearance of symptoms and diagnosis was 30 days. There was a wide range of 
      manifestations: motor symptoms were the most prevalent and cognitive compromise was 
      far less common. All the patients submitted to magnetic resonance imaging of the 
      head and only eight of those who underwent computerised axial tomography displayed 
      multiple insults. The mean survival time was 60 days in the case of the seven deaths 
      and over two years in those who survived. CONCLUSIONS: The symptoms of the patients 
      were similar to those reported in the literature, except for the absence of 
      dementia. Magnetic resonance imaging was better than tomography at detecting 
      multiple, dispersed insults and is more cost-effective for diagnosing PML. The 
      survival time of most of the patients was higher than that reported in previous 
      studies.

TI  - Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection of the nervous system: a 
      review.
PG  - 71-104
AB  - Human immunodeficiency virus type I (HIV-1) is associated with a spectrum of 
      neurological disorders. At the time of primary HIV-1 infection, an acute aseptic 
      meningitis or encephalitis indicates central nervous system invasion. Evidence of 
      HIV-1 infection is found in the CSF of most asymptomatic seropositive individuals, 
      suggesting viral persistence in the nervous system. After a long incubation period, 
      viral activation is signaled by expression of HIV-1 antigen in the CSF, which 
      correlates with a profound dementia in adults or with an analogous progressive 
      encephalopathy in children. The neuropathological substrate of this dementing 
      process consists of multinucleated giant cells and diffuse white matter pallor. 
      Immunocytochemical and in situ hybridization studies demonstrate that antigen 
      presenting cells, including blood derived macrophages and resident brain microglia, 
      are directly infected by HIV-1, and participate in the formation of the syncytial 
      giant cells. Astrocytes and endothelial cells may also be infected, but evidence for 
      infection of oligodendroglia and neurons is lacking. Studies of lentiviral 
      encephalitides in ungulates and non-human primates emphasize the importance of 
      specific viral antigenic stimulation and the role of inflammatory cells as direct or 
      indirect mediators of tissue damage. The disorders of the peripheral nervous system 
      described in patients with HIV-1 infection have not been convincingly linked to 
      direct viral infection. At least two of the neuromuscular complications, the 
      inflammatory motor neuropathy and polymyositis are likely to have an autoimmune 
      pathogenesis.

AB  - Among polyunsaturated omega-3 fatty acids, ALA (alpha-linolenic acid) provided the 
      first coherent multidisciplinary experimental demonstration of the effect of diet 
      (one of its major macronutrient) on the structure, the biochemistry, the physiology 
      and thus the function of the brain. In fact, DHA (docosahexaenoic acid) is one for 
      the major building structures of membrane phospholipids of brain and absolute 
      necessary of neuronal function. It was first demonstrated that the differentiation 
      and functioning of cultured brain cells requires not only ALA, but also the very 
      long polyunsaturated omega-3 (DHA) and omega-6 carbon chains. Then, it was found 
      that ALA acid deficiency alters the course of brain development, perturbs the 
      composition of brain cell membranes, neurones, oligodendrocytes and astrocytes, as 
      well as sub cellular particles such as myelin, nerve endings (synaptosomes) and 
      mitochondria. These alterations induce physicochemical modifications in membranes, 
      lead to biochemical and physiological perturbations, and results in neurosensory and 
      behavioural upset. Consequently, the nature of polyunsaturated fatty acids (in 
      particular omega-3, ALA and DHA) present in formula milks for infants (premature and 
      term) conditions the visual, neurological and cerebral abilities, including 
      intellectual. Dietary omega-3 fatty acids are involved in the prevention of some 
      aspects of ischemic cardiovascular disease (including at the level of cerebral 
      vascularization), and in some neuropsychiatric disorders, particularly depression, 
      as well as in dementia, including Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia. The 
      implication of omega-3 fatty acids in major depression and bipolar disorder 
      (manic-depressive illness) is under evaluation. Their dietary deficiency (and 
      altered hepatic metabolism) can prevent the renewal of membranes and consequently 
      accelerate cerebral ageing; nonetheless, the respective roles of the vascular 
      component on one hand and the cerebral parenchyma itself on the other have not yet 
      been clearly elucidated. Low fat diet may have adverse effects on mood. The nature 
      of the amino acid composition of dietary proteins contributes to cerebral function; 
      taking into account that tryptophan plays a special role. In fact, some 
      indispensable amino acids present in dietary proteins participate to elaborate 
      neurotransmitters (and neuromodulators). The regulation of glycaemia (thanks to the 
      ingestion of food with a low glycaemic index ensuring a low insulin level) improves 
      the quality and duration of intellectual performance, if only because at rest the 
      brain consumes more than 50% of dietary carbohydrates, approximately 80% of which 
      are used only for energy purpose. In infants, adults and aged, as well as in 
      diabetes, poorer glycaemic control is associated with lower performances, for 
      instance on tests of memory. At all ages, and more specifically in aged people, some 
      cognitive functions appear sensitive to short term variations in glucose 
      availability. The presence of dietary fibbers is associated with higher alertness 
      ratings and ensures less perceived stress. Although an increasing number of genetic 
      factors that may affect the risk of neurodegenerative disorders are being 
      identified, number of findings show that dietary factors play major roles in 
      determining whether the brain age successfully of experiences neurodegenerative 
      disorders. Effects of micronutrients have been examined in the accompanying paper.

AB  - Neural stem cells (NSCs) are multipotent cells which are capable of self-replication 
      and differentiation into neurons, astrocytes or oligodendrocytes in the central 
      nervous system (CNS). NSCs are found in two main regions in the adult brain: the 
      subgranular zone (SGZ) in the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) and the subventricular 
      zone (SVZ). The recent discovery of NSCs in the adult mammalian brain has fostered a 
      plethora of translational and preclinical studies to investigate novel approaches 
      for the therapy of neurodegenerative diseases. Melatonin is the major secretory 
      product synthesized and secreted by the pineal gland and shows both a wide 
      distribution within phylogenetically distant organisms from bacteria to humans and a 
      great functional versatility. Recently, accumulated experimental evidence showed 
      that melatonin plays an important role in NSCs, including its proliferation, 
      differentiation and survival, which are modulated by many factors including MAPK/ERK 
      signaling pathway, histone acetylation, neurotrophic factors, transcription factors, 
      and apoptotic genes. The purpose of this review is to summarize the beneficial 
      effects of melatonin on NSCs and further to discuss the potential usage of melatonin 
      and its derivatives or analogues in the treatment of CNS neurodegenerative diseases.

TI  - Reversal of endothelial dysfunction reduces white matter vulnerability in cerebral 
      small vessel disease in rats.
LID - eaam9507 [pii]
LID - 10.1126/scitranslmed.aam9507 [doi]
AB  - Dementia is a major social and economic problem for our aging population. One of the 
      most common of dementia in the elderly is cerebral small vessel disease (SVD). 
      Magnetic resonance scans of SVD patients typically show white matter abnormalities, 
      but we do not understand the mechanistic pathological link between blood vessels and 
      white matter myelin damage. Hypertension is suggested as the cause of sporadic SVD, 
      but a recent alternative hypothesis invokes dysfunction of the blood-brain barrier 
      as the primary cause. In a rat model of SVD, we show that endothelial cell (EC) 
      dysfunction is the first change in development of the disease. Dysfunctional ECs 
      secrete heat shock protein 90α, which blocks oligodendroglial differentiation, 
      contributing to impaired myelination. Treatment with EC-stabilizing drugs reversed 
      these EC and oligodendroglial pathologies in the rat model. EC and oligodendroglial 
      dysfunction were also observed in humans with early, asymptomatic SVD pathology. We 
      identified a loss-of-function mutation in ATPase11B, which caused the EC dysfunction 
      in the rat SVD model, and a single-nucleotide polymorphism in ATPase11B that was 
      associated with white matter abnormalities in humans with SVD. We show that EC 
      dysfunction is a cause of SVD white matter vulnerability and provide a therapeutic 
      strategy to treat and reverse SVD in the rat model, which may also be of relevance 
      to human SVD.

TI  - FUS-mediated dysregulation of Sema5a, an autism-related gene, in FUS mice with 
      hippocampus-dependent cognitive deficits.
PG  - 3777-3791
LID - 10.1093/hmg/ddz217 [doi]
AB  - Pathological fused in sarcoma (FUS) inclusions are found in 10% of patients with 
      frontotemporal dementia and those with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) carrying 
      FUS mutations. Current work indicates that FUS mutations may incur gain-of-toxic 
      functions to drive ALS pathogenesis. However, how FUS dysfunction may affect 
      cognition remains elusive. Using a mouse model expressing wild-type human FUS 
      mimicking the endogenous expression pattern and level within the central nervous 
      system, we found that they developed hippocampus-mediated cognitive deficits 
      accompanied by an age-dependent reduction in spine density and long-term 
      potentiation in their hippocampus. However, there were no apparent FUS aggregates, 
      nuclear envelope defects and cytosolic FUS accumulation. These suggest that these 
      proposed pathogenic mechanisms may not be the underlying causes for the observed 
      cognitive deficits. Unbiased transcriptomic analysis identified expression changes 
      in a small set of genes with preferential expression in the neurons and 
      oligodendrocyte lineage cells. Of these, we focused on Sema5a, a gene involved in 
      axon guidance, spine dynamics, Parkinson's disease and autism spectrum disorders. 
      Critically, FUS binds directly to Sema5a mRNA and regulates Sema5a expression in a 
      FUS-dose-dependent manner. Taken together, our data suggest that FUS-driven Sema5a 
      deregulation may underlie the cognitive deficits in FUS transgenic mice.

TI  - Delayed neurotoxicity in primary central nervous system lymphoma.
PG  - 1595-600
AB  - BACKGROUND: Treatment for primary central nervous lymphoma (PCNSL) with chemotherapy 
      and radiotherapy has resulted in improved survival, but some patients develop 
      neurologic deterioration that represents a treatment-related toxic effect. This 
      delayed neurotoxicity has been poorly defined in the literature, and the underlying 
      mechanisms are unknown. OBJECTIVE: To describe the clinical findings, time course, 
      and pathophysiologic mechanisms associated with neurotoxicity in an attempt to 
      generate hypotheses for future studies that address prevention and treatment of this 
      complication of successful PCNSL therapy. DESIGN: Retrospective review. SETTING: 
      Department of Neurology, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. PATIENTS: One 
      hundred eighty-five patients treated for PCNSL, including 43 who developed 
      neurotoxicity. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Potential risk factors, clinical course, and 
      neuropsychological, neuroimaging, and histologic findings. RESULTS: The 5-year 
      cumulative incidence of neurotoxicity was 24%; this incidence increases over time. 
      Neurotoxicity presented as a rapidly progressive subcortical dementia characterized 
      by psychomotor slowing, executive and memory dysfunction, behavioral changes, gait 
      ataxia, and incontinence. Imaging findings revealed diffuse white matter disease and 
      cortical-subcortical atrophy. Available autopsy data showed white matter damage with 
      gliosis, thickening of small vessels, and demyelination. Statistical analyses were 
      performed, accounting for death as a competing risk. Older age (P = .01), mental 
      status changes at diagnosis (P = .04), female sex (P = .05), and radiotherapy 
      (P<.001) predicted neurotoxicity on univariate analysis, but only radiotherapy 
      remained significant in the multivariate setting. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest 
      that the core pathophysiologic mechanism is the interruption of frontal-subcortical 
      circuits mediated by radiation damage, possibly caused by progressive microvascular 
      alterations, loss of oligodendrocyte progenitors, or oxidative stress.

AB  - Synucleinopathies such as Parkinson's disease (PD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), 
      and multiple system atrophy (MSA) are defined by the presence of intracellular 
      alpha-synuclein aggregates in neurons and/or oligodendrocytes. In addition, post 
      mortem tissue analysis revealed profound changes in microglial morphology, 
      indicating microglial activation and neuroinflammation. Thus, alpha-synuclein may 
      directly activate microglia, leading to increased production of key pro-inflammatory 
      cytokines like tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin-1beta (IL-1β), 
      which in turn modulates the disease progression. The distinct alpha-synuclein 
      species, which mediates the activation of microglia, is not well defined. We 
      hypothesized that microglial activation depends on a specific aggregation state of 
      alpha-synuclein. Here, we show that primarily human fibrillar alpha-synuclein 
      increased the production and secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines by microglial 
      BV2 cells compared to monomeric and oligomeric alpha-synuclein. BV2 cells also 
      preferentially phagocytosed fibrillar alpha-synuclein compared to alpha-synuclein 
      monomers and oligomers. Microglial uptake of alpha-synuclein fibrils and the 
      consequent activation were time- and concentration-dependent. Moreover, the degree 
      of fibrillization determined the efficiency of microglial internalization. Taken 
      together, our study highlights the specific crosstalk of distinct alpha-synuclein 
      species with microglial cells.

TI  - Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy in AIDS: a clinicopathologic study and 
      review of the literature.
PG  - 391-406
AB  - We reviewed the clinical, radiographic, and pathologic features of 15 patients with 
      the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) and progressive multifocal 
      leukoencephalopathy (PML). Brain tissue from 10 autopsy and 6 biopsy specimens was 
      studied using: in situ hybridization (ISH) for JC virus (JCV), immunohistochemistry 
      for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) p24 antigen, and electron microscopy. 
      Thirteen patients presented with focal neurologic deficits, while 2 presented with a 
      rapid decline in mental status. PML was commonly the initial opportunistic infection 
      of AIDS and produced hemiparesis, dementia, dysarthria, cerebellar abnormalities, 
      and seizures. Magnetic resonance imaging was more sensitive than computed tomography 
      in detecting lesions, and often showed multifocal areas of PML. CD4+ T-cell counts 
      were uniformly low (mean 84/mm3), except in 1 patient who improved on 
      3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine (AZT). PML involved the cerebral hemispheres, brain stem, 
      cerebellum, and cervical spinal cord. The distribution of brain involvement was 
      consistent with hematogenous dissemination of the virus. In 2 brain specimens, 
      multiple HIV-type giant cells were present within the regions involved by PML. When 
      co-infection by HIV and papovavirus was present, PML dominated the pathological 
      picture. ISH for JCV showed virus in the nuclei of oligodendrocytes and astrocytes. 
      Occasionally there was staining for JCV in the cytoplasm of glial cells and in the 
      neuropil, the latter possibly a correlate of papovavirus spread between myelin 
      sheaths, as seen by electron microscopy. ISH demonstrated more extensive foci of PML 
      than did routine light microscopy.

TI  - Molecular disorganization of axons adjacent to human lacunar infarcts.
PG  - 736-45
LID - 10.1093/brain/awu398 [doi]
AB  - Cerebral microvascular disease predominantly affects brain white matter and deep 
      grey matter, resulting in ischaemic damage that ranges from lacunar infarcts to 
      white matter hyperintensities seen on magnetic resonance imaging. These lesions are 
      common and result in both clinical stroke syndromes and accumulate over time, 
      resulting in cognitive deficits and dementia. Magnetic resonance imaging studies 
      suggest that these lesions progress over time, accumulate adjacent to prior lesions 
      and have a penumbral region susceptible to further injury. The pathological 
      correlates of this adjacent injury in surviving myelinated axons have not been 
      previously defined. In this study, we sought to determine the molecular organization 
      of axons in tissue adjacent to lacunar infarcts and in the regions surrounding 
      microinfarcts, by determining critical elements in axonal function: the morphology 
      and length of node of Ranvier segments and adjacent paranodal segments. We examined 
      post-mortem brain tissue from six patients with lacunar infarcts and tissue from two 
      patients with autosomal dominant retinal vasculopathy and cerebral 
      leukoencephalopathy (previously known as hereditary endotheliopathy with 
      retinopathy, nephropathy and stroke) who accumulate progressive white matter 
      ischaemic lesions in the form of lacunar and microinfarcts. In axons adjacent to 
      lacunar infarcts yet extending up to 150% of the infarct diameter away, both nodal 
      and paranodal length increase by ∼20% and 80%, respectively, reflecting a loss of 
      normal cell-cell adhesion and signalling between axons and oligodendrocytes. Using 
      premorbid magnetic resonance images, brain regions from patients with retinal 
      vasculopathy and cerebral leukoencephalopathy that harboured periventricular white 
      matter hyperintensities were selected and the molecular organization of axons was 
      determined within these regions. As in regions adjacent to lacunar infarcts, nodal 
      and paranodal length in white matter of these patients is increased. Myelin basic 
      protein and neurofilament immunolabelling demonstrates that axons in these adjacent 
      regions have preserved axonal cytoskeleton organization and are generally 
      myelinated. This indicates that the loss of normal axonal microdomain architecture 
      results from disrupted axoglial signalling in white matter adjacent to lacunar and 
      microinfarcts. The loss of the normal molecular organization of nodes and paranodes 
      is associated with axonal degeneration and may lead to impaired conduction velocity 
      across surviving axons after stroke. These findings demonstrate that the degree of 
      white matter injury associated with cerebral microvascular disease extends well 
      beyond what can be identified using imaging techniques and that an improved 
      understanding of the neurobiology in these regions can drive new therapeutic 
      strategies for this disease entity.

AB  - Synucleinopathies comprise a diverse group of neurodegenerative diseases including 
      Parkinson's disease (PD), dementia with Lewy bodies, and multiple system atrophy. 
      These share a common pathological feature, the deposition of alpha-synuclein (a-syn) 
      in neurons or oligodendroglia. A-syn is highly conserved in vertebrates, but the 
      primary sequence of mouse a-syn differs from that of human at seven positions. 
      However, structural differences of their aggregates remain to be fully 
      characterized. In this study, we found that human and mouse a-syn aggregated in 
      vitro formed morphologically distinct amyloid fibrils exhibiting twisted and 
      straight structures, respectively. Furthermore, we identified different 
      protease-resistant core regions, long and short, in human and mouse a-syn 
      aggregates. Interestingly, among the seven unconserved amino acids, only A53T 
      substitution, one of the familial PD mutations, was responsible for structural 
      conversion to the straight-type. Finally, we checked whether the structural 
      differences are transmissible by seeding and found that human a-syn seeded with A53T 
      aggregates formed straight-type fibrils with short protease-resistant cores. These 
      results suggest that a-syn aggregates form sequence-dependent polymorphic fibrils 
      upon spontaneous aggregation but become seed structure-dependent upon seeding.

AB  - Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a lethal degenerative disorder of 
      motoneurons, which may occur concurrently with frontotemporal dementia. Genetic 
      analyses of the ∼10% of ALS cases that are dominantly inherited provide insight into 
      ALS pathobiology. Two broad themes are evident. One, prompted by investigations of 
      the SOD1 gene, is that conformational instability of proteins triggers downstream 
      neurotoxic processes. The second, from studies of the TDP43, FUS, and C9orf72 genes, 
      is that perturbations of RNA processing can be highly adverse in motoneurons. 
      Several investigations support the concept that non-neuronal cells (microglia, 
      astroglia, oligodendroglia) participate in the degenerative process in ALS. Recent 
      data also emphasize the importance of molecular events in the axon and distal 
      motoneuron terminals. Only 1 compound, riluzole, is approved by the US Food and Drug 
      Administration for ALS; several therapies are in clinical trials, including 2 
      mesenchymal stem cell trials. The challenges and unmet needs in ALS emphasize the 
      importance of new research directions: high-throughput sequencing of large DNA sets 
      of familial and sporadic ALS, which will define scores of candidate ALS genes and 
      pathways and facilitate studies of epistasis and epigenetics; infrastructures for 
      candidate gene validation, including in vitro and in vivo modeling; valid biomarkers 
      that elucidate causative molecular events and accelerate clinical trials; and in the 
      long term, methods to identify environmental toxins. The unprecedented intensity of 
      research in ALS and the advent of extraordinary technologies (rapid, inexpensive DNA 
      sequencing; stem cell production from skin-derived fibroblasts; silencing of 
      miscreant mutant genes) bode well for discovery of innovative ALS therapies.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Mutations in the lysosomal glucocerebrosidase (GBA) gene increase the 
      risk of Parkinson's Disease (PD). We determined the frequency and relative risk of 
      major GBA mutations in a large series of Italian patients with primary parkinsonism. 
      METHODS: We studied 2766 unrelated consecutive patients with clinical diagnosis of 
      primary degenerative parkinsonism (including 2350 PD), and 1111 controls. The entire 
      cohort was screened for mutations in GBA exons 9 and 10, covering approximately 70% 
      of mutations, including the two most frequent defects, p.N370S and p.L444P. RESULTS: 
      Four known mutations were identified in heterozygous state: 3 missense mutations 
      (p.N370S, p.L444P, and p.D443N), and the splicing mutation IVS10+1G>T, which results 
      in the in-frame exon-10 skipping. Molecular characterization of 2 additional rare 
      variants, potentially interfering with splicing, suggested a neutral effect. GBA 
      mutations were more frequent in PD (4.5%, RR = 7.2, CI = 3.3-15.3) and in Dementia 
      with Lewy Bodies (DLB) (13.8%, RR = 21.9, CI = 6.8-70.7) than in controls (0.63%). 
      but not in the other forms of parkinsonism such as Progressive Supranuclear Palsy 
      (PSP, 2%), and Corticobasal Degeneration (CBD, 0%). Considering only the PD group, 
      GBA-carriers were younger at onset (52 ± 10 vs. 57 ± 10 years, P < 0.0001) and were 
      more likely to have a positive family history of PD (34% vs. 20%, P < 0.001). 
      CONCLUSION: GBA dysfunction is relevant for synucleinopathies, such as PD and DLB, 
      except for MSA, in which pathology involves oligodendrocytes, and the tauopathies 
      PSP and CBD. The risk of developing DLB is three-fold higher than PD, suggesting a 
      more aggressive phenotype.

AB  - Diabetes mellitus (DM) is the most commonly occurring cause of neuropathy around the 
      world and is beginning to grow in countries where there is a risk of obesity. DM 
      Type II, (T2DM) is a common age-related disease and is a major health concern, 
      particularly in developed countries in Europe where the population is aging. T2DM is 
      a chronic disease which is characterised by hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia and 
      insulin resistance, together with the body's inability to use glucose as energy. 
      Such metabolic disorder produces a chronic inflammatory state, as well as changes in 
      lipid metabolism leading to hypertriglyceridemia, thereby producing chronic 
      deterioration of the organs and premature morbidity and mortality. The pathology's 
      effects increase cerebral damage, leading to the rapid onset of neurodegenerative 
      diseases. Hyperglycemia causes oxidative stress in tissues which are susceptible to 
      the complications involved in diabetes, including peripheral nerves. Other 
      additional mechanisms include activation of polyol aldose reductase signalling 
      accompanied by protein kinase C (PKC)-ß activation, poly(ADP ribose) polymerase 
      activation, cyclooxygenase (COX) 2 activation, endothelial dysfunction, altered 
      Na+/K+ ATPase pump function, dyslipidaemia and perturbation of calcium balance. All 
      the forgoing has an impact on neuron activity, mitochondrial function, membrane 
      permeability and endothelial function. These biochemical processes directly affect 
      the neurons and endothelial tissue, thereby accelerating cerebral aging by means of 
      peroxidation of the polyunsaturated fatty acids and thus injuring cell membrane 
      integrity and inducing apoptosis in the glial cells. The Central Nervous System 
      (CNS) includes two types de glial cells: microglia and macroglia (astrocytes, 
      oligodendrocytes and radial cells which include Bergmann cells and Müller cells). 
      Glial cells constitute more than 90% of the CNS cell population. Human studies have 
      shown that some oral antidiabetic drugs can improve cognition in patients suffering 
      mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia [1, 2]. While it is still unclear 
      whether diabetes management will reduce MCI and Alzheimer's disease (AD), incidence, 
      emerging evidence suggests that diabetes therapies may improve cognitive function. 
      This review focuses three aspects: the clinical manifestation of diabetes regarding 
      glial and neuronal cells, the association between neurodegeneration and diabetes and 
      summarises some of the pharmacogenomic data obtained from studies of T2DM treatment, 
      focusing on polymorphisms in genes affecting pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and 
      treatment outcome of the most commonly-prescribed oral anti-diabetic drugs (OADs).

TI  - [Oxidative stress involvement in schizophrenia pathophysiology: a review].
PG  - 244-52
AB  - BACKGROUND: Schizophrenia is a devastating psychiatric disorder with a broad range 
      of behavioural and biologic manifestations. There are several clinical 
      characteristics of the illness that have been consistently associated with poor 
      premorbid adjustment, long duration of psychosis prior to treatment and prominent 
      negative symptoms. The etiopathogenic mechanisms of lack of insight in patients with 
      schizophrenia are to date unknown, although several hypotheses have been suggested. 
      A point of convergence for the theoretical models occurs with regard to the neuronal 
      membrane. Neuronal membrane contains a high proportion of polyunsaturated fatty acid 
      and is the site for oxidative stress. Oxidative stress is a state when there is 
      unbalance between the generation of reactive oxygen species and antioxidant defence 
      capacity of the body. It is closely associated with a number of diseases including 
      Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer-type dementia and Huntington's chorea. Accumulating 
      evidence points to many interrelated mechanisms that increase production of reactive 
      oxygen or decrease antioxidant protection in schizophrenic patients. OBJECTIVES: 
      This review aims to summarize the perturbations in antioxidant protection systems 
      during schizophrenia, their interrelationships with the characteristic clinics and 
      therapeutics and the implications of these observations in the pathophysiology of 
      schizophrenia are discussed. LITERATURE FINDINGS: In schizophrenia there is evidence 
      for deregulation of free radical metabolism, as detected by abnormal activity of 
      critical antioxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase and 
      catalase). Many studies conclude in the decrease in the activity of key antioxidant 
      enzymes in schizophrenia. A few studies have examined levels of non enzymatic 
      antioxidants such as plasma antioxidant proteins (albumin, bilirubine, uric acid) 
      and trace elements. How showed decreased levels in schizophrenic patients. Others 
      studies have provided evidence of oxidative membrane damage by examining levels of 
      lipid peroxidation products. Such abnormalities have been associated with certain 
      clinical symptoms and therapeutic features. Negative symptoms have been associated 
      with low levels of GSH-Px. Positive symptoms have been positively correlated with 
      SOD activity. Plasma TAS was significantly lower in drug-free and haloperidol 
      treated patients with schizophrenia. A low erythrocyte SOD activity has been found 
      in never-treated patients, but with haloperidol treatment, SOD activity increased. 
      DISCUSSION: These results demonstrate altered membrane dynamics and antioxidant 
      enzyme activity in schizophrenia. Membrane dysfunction can be secondary to free a 
      radical-mediated pathology, and may contribute to specific aspects of the 
      schizophrenia symptomatology. Membrane defects can significantly alter a broad range 
      of membrane functions and presumably modify behavior through multiple downstream 
      biological effects. Phospholipid metabolism in the brain may be perturbed in 
      schizophrenia, with reduced amounts of phosphatidylcholins and 
      phosphatidylethanolamine in post-mortem brain tissue from schizophrenic patients, 
      and large amounts of lipofuscin-like materiel in the oligodendrocytes. The existence 
      of these products within cell membranes results in an unstable membrane structure, 
      altered membrane fluidity and permeability and impaired signal transduction. Recent 
      findings suggest that multiple neurotransmitter systems may be faulty. CNS cells are 
      more vulnerable to the toxic effects of free radicals because they have a high rate 
      of catecholamine oxidative metabolic activity. Neurotransmitters, like glutamate, 
      can induce the same metabolic processes that increase free radical production and 
      can lead to impaired dopamine-glutamate balance. These results question the role of 
      this imbalance in the biochemical basis evoked in the etipathogenic mechanisms of 
      schizophrenia, as well as the role of antioxidants in the therapeutic strategy and 
      their implication in preventive and early intervention approaches in populations at 
      risk for schizophrenia.

AB  - Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) leads to diverse symptoms including mood 
      disorders, cognitive decline, and behavioral changes. In some individuals, these 
      symptoms become chronic and persist in the long-term and can confer an increased 
      risk of neurodegenerative disease and dementia diagnosis later in life. Despite the 
      severity of its consequences, the pathophysiological mechanism of mTBI remains 
      unknown. In this post-mortem case series, we assessed DNA damage-induced cellular 
      senescence pathways in 38 professional athletes with a history of repeated mTBI and 
      ten controls with no mTBI history. We assessed clinical presentation, 
      neuropathological changes, load of DNA damage, morphological markers of cellular 
      senescence, and expression of genes involved in DNA damage signaling, DNA repair, 
      and cellular senescence including the senescence-associated secretory phenotype 
      (SASP). Twenty-eight brains with past history of repeated mTBI history had DNA 
      damage within ependymal cells, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes. DNA damage burden 
      was increased in brains with proteinopathy compared to those without. Cases also 
      showed hallmark features of cellular senescence in glial cells including astrocytic 
      swelling, beading of glial cell processes, loss of H3K27Me3 (trimethylation at 
      lysine 27 of histone H3) and lamin B1 expression, and increased expression of 
      cellular senescence and SASP pathways. Neurons showed a spectrum of changes 
      including loss of emerin nuclear membrane expression, loss of Brahma-related gene-1 
      (BRG1 or SMARCA4) expression, loss of myelin basic protein (MBP) axonal expression, 
      and translocation of intranuclear tau to the cytoplasm. Expression of DNA repair 
      proteins was decreased in mTBI brains. mTBI brains showed substantial evidence of 
      DNA damage and cellular senescence. Decreased expression of DNA repair genes 
      suggests inefficient DNA repair pathways in this cohort, conferring susceptibly to 
      cellular senescence and subsequent brain dysfunction after mTBI. We therefore 
      suggest that brains of contact-sports athletes are characterized by deficient DNA 
      repair and DNA damage-induced cellular senescence and propose that this may affect 
      neurons and be the driver of brain dysfunction in mTBI, predisposing the progression 
      to neurodegenerative diseases. This study provides novel targets for diagnostic and 
      prognostic biomarkers, and represents viable targets for future treatments.

AB  - Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is strongly linked to an increased risk of developing 
      dementia, including chronic traumatic encephalopathy and possibly Alzheimer's 
      disease (AD). APOEε4 allele of human Apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene is the major 
      genetic risk factor for late onset AD and has been associated with chronic traumatic 
      encephalopathy and unfavorable outcome following TBI. To determine if there is an 
      APOE isoform-specific response to TBI we performed controlled cortical impact on 
      3-month-old mice expressing human APOE3 or APOE4 isoforms. Following injury, we used 
      several behavior paradigms to test for anxiety and learning and found that APOE3 and 
      APOE4 targeted replacement mice demonstrate cognitive impairments following moderate 
      TBI. Transcriptional profiling 14days following injury revealed a significant effect 
      of TBI, which was similar in both genotypes. Significantly upregulated by injury in 
      both genotypes were mRNA expression and protein level of ABCA1 transporter and APOJ, 
      but not APOE. To identify gene-networks correlated to injury and APOE isoform, we 
      performed Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis. We determined that the 
      network mostly correlated to TBI in animals expressing both isoforms is immune 
      response with major hub genes including Trem2, Tyrobp, Clec7a and Cd68. We also 
      found a significant increase of TREM2, IBA-1 and GFAP protein levels in the brains 
      of injured mice. We identified a network representing myelination that correlated 
      significantly with APOE isoform in both injury groups. This network was 
      significantly enriched in oligodendrocyte signature genes, such as Mbp and Plp1. Our 
      results demonstrate unique and distinct gene networks at this acute time point for 
      injury and APOE isoform, as well as a network driven by APOE isoform across TBI 
      groups.

TI  - Potential role of 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase 1 as a STAT1 coactivator in 
      endotoxin-induced inflammatory response.

AB  - Human 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase 1 (OGG1) is the major DNA repair enzyme that 
      plays a key role in excision of oxidative damaged DNA bases such as 8-oxoguainine 
      (8-oxoG). Recent studies suggest another function of OGG1, namely that it may be 
      involved in the endotoxin- or oxidative stress-induced inflammatory response. In 
      this study, we investigated the role of OGG1 in the inflammatory response. OGG1 
      expression is increased in the organs of endotoxin-induced or myelin oligodendrocyte 
      glycoprotein (MOG)-immunized mice and immune cells, resulting in induction of the 
      expression of pro-inflammatory mediators at the transcriptional levels. Biochemical 
      studies showed that signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) plays 
      a key role in endotoxin-induced OGG1 expression and inflammatory response. STAT1 
      regulates the transcriptional activity of OGG1 through recruiting and binding to the 
      gamma-interferon activation site (GAS) motif of the OGG1 promoter region, and 
      chromatin remodeling by acetylation and dimethylation of lysine-14 and -4 residues 
      of histone H3. In addition, OGG1 acts as a STAT1 coactivator and has transcriptional 
      activity in the presence of endotoxin. The data presented here identifies a novel 
      mechanism, and may provide new therapeutic strategies for the treatment of 
      endotoxin-mediated inflammatory diseases.

TI  - Roles of unsaturated fatty acids (especially omega-3 fatty acids) in the brain at 
      various ages and during ageing.
PG  - 163-74
AB  - Among various organs, in the brain, the fatty acids most extensively studied are 
      omega-3 fatty acids. Alpha-linolenic acid (18:3omega3) deficiency alters the 
      structure and function of membranes and induces minor cerebral dysfunctions, as 
      demonstrated in animal models and subsequently in human infants. Even though the 
      brain is materially an organ like any other, that is to say elaborated from 
      substances present in the diet (sometimes exclusively), for long it was not accepted 
      that food can have an influence on brain structure, and thus on its function. 
      Lipids, and especially omega-3 fatty acids, provided the first coherent experimental 
      demonstration of the effect of diet (nutrients) on the structure and function of the 
      brain. In fact the brain, after adipose tissue, is the organ richest in lipids, 
      whose only role is to participate in membrane structure. First it was shown that the 
      differentiation and functioning of cultured brain cells requires not only 
      alpha-linolenic acid (the major component of the omega-3, omega3 family), but also 
      the very long omega-3 and omega-6 carbon chains (1). It was then demonstrated that 
      alpha-linolenic acid deficiency alters the course of brain development, perturbs the 
      composition and physicochemical properties of brain cell membranes, neurones, 
      oligodendrocytes, and astrocytes (2). This leads to physicochemical modifications, 
      induces biochemical and physiological perturbations, and results in neurosensory and 
      behavioural upset (3). Consequently, the nature of polyunsaturated fatty acids (in 
      particular omega-3) present in formula milks for infants (premature and term) 
      conditions the visual and cerebral abilities, including intellectual. Moreover, 
      dietary omega-3 fatty acids are certainly involved in the prevention of some aspects 
      of cardiovascular disease (including at the level of cerebral vascularization), and 
      in some neuropsychiatric disorders, particularly depression, as well as in dementia, 
      notably Alzheimer's disease. Recent results have shown that dietary alpha-linolenic 
      acid deficiency induces more marked abnormalities in certain cerebral structures 
      than in others, as the frontal cortex and pituitary gland are more severely 
      affected. These selective lesions are accompanied by behavioural disorders more 
      particularly affecting certain tests (habituation, adaptation to new situations). 
      Biochemical and behavioural abnormalities are partially reversed by a dietary 
      phospholipid supplement, especially omega-3-rich egg yolk extracts or pig brain. A 
      dose-effect study showed that animal phospholipids are more effective than plant 
      phospholipids to reverse the consequences of alpha-linolenic acid deficiency, partly 
      because they provide very long preformed chains. Alpha-linolenic acid deficiency 
      decreases the perception of pleasure, by slightly altering the efficacy of sensory 
      organs and by affecting certain cerebral structures. Age-related impairment of 
      hearing, vision and smell is due to both decreased efficacy of the parts of the 
      brain concerned and disorders of sensory receptors, particularly of the inner ear or 
      retina. For example, a given level of perception of a sweet taste requires a larger 
      quantity of sugar in subjects with alpha-linolenic acid deficiency. In view of 
      occidental eating habits, as omega-6 fatty acid deficiency has never been observed, 
      its impact on the brain has not been studied. In contrast, omega-9 fatty acid 
      deficiency, specifically oleic acid deficiency, induces a reduction of this fatty 
      acid in many tissues, except the brain (but the sciatic nerve is affected). This 
      fatty acid is therefore not synthesized in sufficient quantities, at least during 
      pregnancy-lactation, implying a need for dietary intake. It must be remembered that 
      organization of the neurons is almost complete several weeks before birth, and that 
      these neurons remain for the subject's life time. Consequently, any disturbance of 
      these neurons, an alteration of their connections, and impaired turnover of their 
      constituents at any stage of life, will tend to accelerate ageing. The enzymatic 
      activities of sytivities of synthesis of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids from 
      linoleic and alpha-linolenic acids are very limited in the brain: this organ 
      therefore depends on an exogenous supply. Consequently, fatty acids that are 
      essential for the brain are arachidonic acid and cervonic acid, derived from the 
      diet, unless they are synthesized by the liver from linoleic acid and 
      alpha-linolenic acid. The age-related reduction of hepatic desaturase activities 
      (which participate in the synthesis of long chains, together with elongases) can 
      impair turnover of cerebral membranes. In many structures, especially in the frontal 
      cortex, a reduction of cervonic and arachidonic acids is observed during ageing, 
      predominantly associated with a reduction of phosphatidylethanolamines (mainly in 
      the form of plasmalogens). Peroxisomal oxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids 
      decreases in the brain during ageing, participating in decreased turnover of 
      membrane fatty acids, which are also less effectively protected against peroxidation 
      by free radicals.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to examine the putative adverse effects of 
      ambient fine particulate matter (PM2.5 : PM with aerodynamic diameters <2.5μm) on 
      brain volumes in older women. METHODS: We conducted a prospective study of 1,403 
      community-dwelling older women without dementia enrolled in the Women's Health 
      Initiative Memory Study, 1996-1998. Structural brain magnetic resonance imaging 
      scans were performed at the age of 71-89 years in 2005-2006 to obtain volumetric 
      measures of gray matter (GM) and normal-appearing white matter (WM). Given 
      residential histories and air monitoring data, we used a spatiotemporal model to 
      estimate cumulative PM2.5 exposure in 1999-2006. Multiple linear regression was 
      employed to evaluate the associations between PM2.5 and brain volumes, adjusting for 
      intracranial volumes and potential confounders. RESULTS: Older women with greater 
      PM2.5 exposures had significantly smaller WM, but not GM, volumes, independent of 
      geographical region, demographics, socioeconomic status, lifestyles, and clinical 
      characteristics, including cardiovascular risk factors. For each interquartile 
      increment (3.49μg/m(3) ) of cumulative PM2.5 exposure, the average WM volume (WMV; 
      95% confidence interval) was 6.23cm(3) (3.72-8.74) smaller in the total brain and 
      4.47cm(3) (2.27-6.67) lower in the association areas, equivalent to 1 to 2 years of 
      brain aging. The adverse PM2.5 effects on smaller WMVs were present in frontal and 
      temporal lobes and corpus callosum (all p values <0.01). Hippocampal volumes did not 
      differ by PM2.5 exposure. INTERPRETATION: PM2.5 exposure may contribute to WM loss 
      in older women. Future studies are needed to determine whether exposures result in 
      myelination disturbance, disruption of axonal integrity, damages to 
      oligodendrocytes, or other WM neuropathologies.

AB  - AIMS: Multiple system atrophy (MSA) is pathologically characterized by the formation 
      of α-synuclein-containing glial cytoplasmic inclusions (GCIs) in oligodendrocytes. 
      However, the mechanisms of GCI formation are not fully understood. Cellular 
      machinery for the formation of aggresomes has been linked to the biogenesis of the 
      Lewy body, a characteristic α-synuclein-containing inclusion of Parkinson's disease 
      and dementia with Lewy bodies. Here, we examined whether GCIs contain the components 
      of aggresomes by immunohistochemistry. METHODS: Sections from five patients with MSA 
      were stained immunohistochemically with antibodies against aggresome-related 
      proteins and analysed in comparison with sections from five patients with no 
      neurological disease. We evaluated the presence or absence of aggresome-related 
      proteins in GCIs by double immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy. 
      RESULTS: GCIs were clearly immunolabelled with antibodies against aggresome-related 
      proteins, such as γ-tubulin, histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) and 20S proteasome 
      subunits. Neuronal cytoplasmic inclusions (NCIs) were also immunopositive for these 
      aggresome-related proteins. Double immunofluorescence staining and quantitative 
      analysis demonstrated that the majority of GCIs contained these proteins, as well as 
      other aggresome-related proteins, such as Hsp70, Hsp90 and 62-kDa 
      protein/sequestosome 1 (p62/SQSTM1). Immunoelectron microscopy demonstrated 
      immunoreactivities for γ-tubulin and HDAC6 along the fibrils comprising GCIs. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that GCIs, and probably NCIs, share at least some 
      characteristics with aggresomes in terms of their protein components. Therefore, 
      GCIs and NCIs may be another manifestation of aggresome-related inclusion bodies 
      observed in neurodegenerative diseases.

AB  - Multiple system atrophy (MSA) is a devastating neurodegenerative disease 
      characterized by the clinical triad of parkinsonism, cerebellar ataxia and autonomic 
      failure, impacting on striatonigral, olivopontocerebellar and autonomic systems. At 
      early stage of the disease, the clinical symptoms of MSA can overlap with those of 
      Parkinson's disease (PD). The key pathological hallmark of MSA is the presence of 
      glial cytoplasmic inclusions (GCI) in oligodendrocytes. GCI comprise insoluble 
      proteinaceous filaments composed chiefly of α-synuclein aggregates, and therefore 
      MSA is regarded as an α-synucleinopathy along with PD and dementia with Lewy bodies. 
      The etiology of MSA is unknown, and the pathogenesis of MSA is still largely 
      speculative. Much data suggests that MSA is a sporadic disease, although some 
      emerging evidence suggests rare genetic variants increase susceptibility. Currently, 
      there is no general consensus on the susceptibility genes as there have been 
      differences due to geographical distribution or ethnicity. Furthermore, many of the 
      reported studies have been conducted on patients that were only clinically diagnosed 
      without pathological verification. The purpose of this review is to bring together 
      available evidence to cross-examine the susceptibility genes and genetic 
      pathomechanisms implicated in MSA. We explore the possible involvement of the SNCA, 
      COQ2, MAPT, GBA1, LRRK2 and C9orf72 genes in MSA pathogenesis, highlight the 
      under-explored areas of MSA genetics, and discuss future directions of research in 
      MSA.

AB  - Nasu-Hakola disease (NHD) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder, characterized by 
      progressive presenile dementia and formation of multifocal bone cysts, caused by a 
      loss-of-function mutation of DNAX-activation protein 12 (DAP12) or triggering 
      receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2). TREM2 and DAP12 constitute a 
      receptor/adaptor complex on myeloid cells. The post-receptor signals are transmitted 
      via rapid phosphorylation of the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activating motif 
      (ITAM) of DAP12, mediated by Src protein tyrosine kinases, followed by binding of 
      phosphorylated ITAM to Src homology 2 (SH2) domains of spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk), 
      resulting in autophosphorylation of the activation loop of Syk. To elucidate the 
      molecular mechanism underlying the pathogenesis of NHD, we investigated Syk 
      expression and activation in the frontal cortex and the hippocampus of three NHD and 
      eight control brains by immunohistochemistry. In NHD brains, the majority of neurons 
      expressed intense immunoreactivities for Syk and Y525/Y526-phosphorylated Syk (pSyk) 
      chiefly located in the cytoplasm, while more limited populations of neurons 
      expressed Src. The levels of pSyk expression were elevated significantly in NHD 
      brains compared with control brains. In both NHD and control brains, substantial 
      populations of microglia and macrophages expressed pSyk, while the great majority of 
      reactive astrocytes and myelinating oligodendrocytes did not express pSyk, Syk or 
      Src. These observations indicate that neuronal expression of pSyk was greatly 
      enhanced in the cerebral cortex and the hippocampus of NHD brains, possibly via 
      non-TREM2/DAP12 signaling pathways involved in Syk activation.

TI  - Safety and efficacy of epigallocatechin gallate in multiple system atrophy 
      (PROMESA): a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.
PG  - 724-735

AB  - BACKGROUND: Multiple system atrophy is a rare neurodegenerative disease 
      characterised by aggregation of α-synuclein in oligodendrocytes and neurons. The 
      polyphenol epigallocatechin gallate inhibits α-synuclein aggregation and reduces 
      associated toxicity. We aimed to establish if epigallocatechin gallate could safely 
      slow disease progression in patients with multiple system atrophy. METHODS: We did a 
      randomised, double-blind, parallel group, placebo-controlled clinical trial at 12 
      specialist centres in Germany. Eligible participants were older than 30 years; met 
      consensus criteria for possible or probable multiple system atrophy and could 
      ambulate independently (ie, were at Hoehn and Yahr stages 1-3); and were on stable 
      anti-Parkinson's, anti-dysautonomia, anti-dementia, and anti-depressant regimens (if 
      necessary) for at least 1 month. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to 
      epigallocatechin gallate or placebo (mannitol) via a web-generated permuted 
      blockwise randomisation list (block size=2) that was stratified by disease subtype 
      (parkinsonism-predominant disease vs cerebellar-ataxia-predominant disease). All 
      participants and study personnel were masked to treatment assignment. Participants 
      were given one hard gelatin capsule (containing either 400 mg epigallocatechin 
      gallate or mannitol) orally once daily for 4 weeks, then one capsule twice daily for 
      4 weeks, and then one capsule three times daily for 40 weeks. After 48 weeks, all 
      patients underwent a 4-week wash-out period. The primary endpoint was change in 
      motor examination score of the Unified Multiple System Atrophy Rating Scale (UMSARS) 
      from baseline to 52 weeks. Efficacy analyses were done in all people who received at 
      least one dose of study medication. Safety was analysed in all people who received 
      at least one dose of the study medication to which they had been randomly assigned. 
      This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02008721) and EudraCT 
      (2012-000928-18), and is completed. FINDINGS: Between April 23, 2014, and Sept 3, 
      2015, 127 participants were screened and 92 were randomly assigned-47 to 
      epigallocatechin gallate and 45 to placebo. Of these, 67 completed treatment and 64 
      completed the study (altough one of these patients had a major protocol violation). 
      There was no evidence of a difference in the mean change from baseline to week 52 in 
      motor examination scores on UMSARS between the epigallocatechin gallate (5·66 [SE 
      1·01]) and placebo (6·60 [0·99]) groups (mean difference -0·94 [SE 1·41; 95% CI 
      -3·71 to 1·83]; p=0·51). Four patients in the epigallocatechin gallate group and two 
      in the placebo group died. Two patients in the epigallocatechin gallate group had to 
      stop treatment because of hepatotoxicity. INTERPRETATION: 48 weeks of 
      epigallocatechin gallate treatment did not modify disease progression in patients 
      with multiple system atrophy. Epigallocatechin gallate was overall well tolerated 
      but was associated with hepatotoxic effects in some patients, and thus doses of more 
      than 1200 mg should not be used. FUNDING: ParkinsonFonds Deutschland, German

TI  - Genome-wide association study of cerebral small vessel disease reveals established 
      and novel loci.
PG  - 3176-3189
LID - 10.1093/brain/awz233 [doi]
AB  - Intracerebral haemorrhage and small vessel ischaemic stroke (SVS) are the most acute 
      manifestations of cerebral small vessel disease, with no established preventive 
      approaches beyond hypertension management. Combined genome-wide association study 
      (GWAS) of these two correlated diseases may improve statistical power to detect 
      novel genetic factors for cerebral small vessel disease, elucidating underlying 
      disease mechanisms that may form the basis for future treatments. Because 
      intracerebral haemorrhage location is an adequate surrogate for distinct 
      histopathological variants of cerebral small vessel disease (lobar for cerebral 
      amyloid angiopathy and non-lobar for arteriolosclerosis), we performed GWAS of 
      intracerebral haemorrhage by location in 1813 subjects (755 lobar and 1005 
      non-lobar) and 1711 stroke-free control subjects. Intracerebral haemorrhage GWAS 
      results by location were meta-analysed with GWAS results for SVS from MEGASTROKE, 
      using 'Multi-Trait Analysis of GWAS' (MTAG) to integrate summary data across traits 
      and generate combined effect estimates. After combining intracerebral haemorrhage 
      and SVS datasets, our sample size included 241 024 participants (6255 intracerebral 
      haemorrhage or SVS cases and 233 058 control subjects). Genome-wide significant 
      associations were observed for non-lobar intracerebral haemorrhage enhanced by SVS 
      with rs2758605 [MTAG P-value (P) = 2.6 × 10-8] at 1q22; rs72932727 (P = 1.7 × 10-8) 
      at 2q33; and rs9515201 (P = 5.3 × 10-10) at 13q34. In the GTEx gene expression 
      library, rs2758605 (1q22), rs72932727 (2q33) and rs9515201 (13q34) are significant 
      cis-eQTLs for PMF1 (P = 1 × 10-4 in tibial nerve), NBEAL1, FAM117B and CARF (P < 2.1 
      × 10-7 in arteries) and COL4A2 and COL4A1 (P < 0.01 in brain putamen), respectively. 
      Leveraging S-PrediXcan for gene-based association testing with the predicted 
      expression models in tissues related with nerve, artery, and non-lobar brain, we 
      found that experiment-wide significant (P < 8.5 × 10-7) associations at three genes 
      at 2q33 including NBEAL1, FAM117B and WDR12 and genome-wide significant associations 
      at two genes including ICA1L at 2q33 and ZCCHC14 at 16q24. Brain cell-type specific 
      expression profiling libraries reveal that SEMA4A, SLC25A44 and PMF1 at 1q22 and 
      COL4A1 and COL4A2 at 13q34 were mainly expressed in endothelial cells, while the 
      genes at 2q33 (FAM117B, CARF and NBEAL1) were expressed in various cell types 
      including astrocytes, oligodendrocytes and neurons. Our cross-phenotype genetic 
      study of intracerebral haemorrhage and SVS demonstrates novel genome-wide 
      associations for non-lobar intracerebral haemorrhage at 2q33 and 13q34. Our 
      replication of the 1q22 locus previous seen in traditional GWAS of intracerebral 
      haemorrhage, as well as the rediscovery of 13q34, which had previously been reported 
      in candidate gene studies with other cerebral small vessel disease-related traits 
      strengthens the credibility of applying this novel genome-wide approach across 
      intracerebral haemorrhage and SVS.

TI  - Genetic identification of cell types underlying brain complex traits yields insights 
      into the etiology of Parkinson's disease.
PG  - 482-493

AB  - Genome-wide association studies have discovered hundreds of loci associated with 
      complex brain disorders, but it remains unclear in which cell types these loci are 
      active. Here we integrate genome-wide association study results with single-cell 
      transcriptomic data from the entire mouse nervous system to systematically identify 
      cell types underlying brain complex traits. We show that psychiatric disorders are 
      predominantly associated with projecting excitatory and inhibitory neurons. 
      Neurological diseases were associated with different cell types, which is consistent 
      with other lines of evidence. Notably, Parkinson's disease was genetically 
      associated not only with cholinergic and monoaminergic neurons (which include 
      dopaminergic neurons) but also with enteric neurons and oligodendrocytes. Using 
      post-mortem brain transcriptomic data, we confirmed alterations in these cells, even 
      at the earliest stages of disease progression. Our study provides an important 
      framework for understanding the cellular basis of complex brain maladies, and 
      reveals an unexpected role of oligodendrocytes in Parkinson's disease.

TI  - Gene co-expression analysis identifies brain regions and cell types involved in 
      migraine pathophysiology: a GWAS-based study using the Allen Human Brain Atlas.
PG  - 425-439

AB  - Migraine is a common disabling neurovascular brain disorder typically characterised 
      by attacks of severe headache and associated with autonomic and neurological 
      symptoms. Migraine is caused by an interplay of genetic and environmental factors. 
      Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified over a dozen genetic loci 
      associated with migraine. Here, we integrated migraine GWAS data with 
      high-resolution spatial gene expression data of normal adult brains from the Allen 
      Human Brain Atlas to identify specific brain regions and molecular pathways that are 
      possibly involved in migraine pathophysiology. To this end, we used two 
      complementary methods. In GWAS data from 23,285 migraine cases and 95,425 controls, 
      we first studied modules of co-expressed genes that were calculated based on human 
      brain expression data for enrichment of genes that showed association with migraine. 
      Enrichment of a migraine GWAS signal was found for five modules that suggest 
      involvement in migraine pathophysiology of: (i) neurotransmission, protein 
      catabolism and mitochondria in the cortex; (ii) transcription regulation in the 
      cortex and cerebellum; and (iii) oligodendrocytes and mitochondria in subcortical 
      areas. Second, we used the high-confidence genes from the migraine GWAS as a basis 
      to construct local migraine-related co-expression gene networks. Signatures of all 
      brain regions and pathways that were prominent in the first method also surfaced in 
      the second method, thus providing support that these brain regions and pathways are 
      indeed involved in migraine pathophysiology.

AB  - Here, we present a large (n = 107,207) genome-wide association study (GWAS) of 
      general cognitive ability ("g"), further enhanced by combining results with a 
      large-scale GWAS of educational attainment. We identified 70 independent genomic 
      loci associated with general cognitive ability. Results showed significant 
      enrichment for genes causing Mendelian disorders with an intellectual disability 
      phenotype. Competitive pathway analysis implicated the biological processes of 
      neurogenesis and synaptic regulation, as well as the gene targets of two 
      pharmacologic agents: cinnarizine, a T-type calcium channel blocker, and LY97241, a 
      potassium channel inhibitor. Transcriptome-wide and epigenome-wide analysis revealed 
      that the implicated loci were enriched for genes expressed across all brain regions 
      (most strongly in the cerebellum). Enrichment was exclusive to genes expressed in 
      neurons but not oligodendrocytes or astrocytes. Finally, we report genetic 
      correlations between cognitive ability and disparate phenotypes including 
      psychiatric disorders, several autoimmune disorders, longevity, and maternal age at 
      first birth.
