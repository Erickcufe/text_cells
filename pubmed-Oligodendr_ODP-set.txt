TI  - Oligodendrocytes in Development, Myelin Generation and Beyond.

AB  - Oligodendrocytes are the myelinating cells of the central nervous system (CNS) that 
      are generated from oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPC). OPC are distributed 
      throughout the CNS and represent a pool of migratory and proliferative adult 
      progenitor cells that can differentiate into oligodendrocytes. The central function 
      of oligodendrocytes is to generate myelin, which is an extended membrane from the 
      cell that wraps tightly around axons. Due to this energy consuming process and the 
      associated high metabolic turnover oligodendrocytes are vulnerable to cytotoxic and 
      excitotoxic factors. Oligodendrocyte pathology is therefore evident in a range of 
      disorders including multiple sclerosis, schizophrenia and Alzheimer's disease. 
      Deceased oligodendrocytes can be replenished from the adult OPC pool and lost myelin 
      can be regenerated during remyelination, which can prevent axonal degeneration and 
      can restore function. Cell population studies have recently identified novel 
      immunomodulatory functions of oligodendrocytes, the implications of which, e.g., for 
      diseases with primary oligodendrocyte pathology, are not yet clear. Here, we review 
      the journey of oligodendrocytes from the embryonic stage to their role in 
      homeostasis and their fate in disease. We will also discuss the most common models 
      used to study oligodendrocytes and describe newly discovered functions of 
      oligodendrocytes.

AB  - There is currently little information available about how individual cell types 
      contribute to Alzheimer's disease. Here we applied single-nucleus RNA sequencing to 
      entorhinal cortex samples from control and Alzheimer's disease brains (n = 6 per 
      group), yielding a total of 13,214 high-quality nuclei. We detail cell-type-specific 
      gene expression patterns, unveiling how transcriptional changes in specific cell 
      subpopulations are associated with Alzheimer's disease. We report that the 
      Alzheimer's disease risk gene APOE is specifically repressed in Alzheimer's disease 
      oligodendrocyte progenitor cells and astrocyte subpopulations and upregulated in an 
      Alzheimer's disease-specific microglial subopulation. Integrating transcription 
      factor regulatory modules with Alzheimer's disease risk loci revealed drivers of 
      cell-type-specific state transitions towards Alzheimer's disease. For example, 
      transcription factor EB, a master regulator of lysosomal function, regulates 
      multiple disease genes in a specific Alzheimer's disease astrocyte subpopulation. 
      These results provide insights into the coordinated control of Alzheimer's disease 
      risk genes and their cell-type-specific contribution to disease susceptibility.

AB  - Extensive evidence has indicated that the breakdown of myelin is associated with 
      Alzheimer's disease (AD) since the vulnerability of oligodendrocytes under 
      Alzheimer's pathology easily induces the myelin breakdown and the loss of the myelin 
      sheath which might be the initiating step in the changes of the earliest stage of AD 
      prior to appearance of amyloid and tau pathology. Considerable research implicated 
      that beta-amyloid (Aβ)-mediated oligodendrocyte dysfunction and myelin breakdown may 
      be via neuroinflammation, oxidative stress and/or apoptosis. It also seems that the 
      oligodendrocyte dysfunction is triggered by the formation of neurofibrillary tangles 
      (NFTs) through inflammation and oxidative stress as the common pathophysiological 
      base. Impaired repair of oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) might possibly 
      enhance the disease progress under decreased self-healing ability from aging process 
      and pathological factors including Aβ pathology and/or NFTs. Thus, these results 
      have suggested that targeting oligodendrocytes may be a novel therapeutic 
      intervention for the prevention and treatment of AD.

AB  - Oligodendrocytes form the myelin that ensheaths CNS axons, which is essential for 
      rapid neuronal signalling and underpins the massive computing power of the human 
      brain. Oligodendrocytes and myelin also provide metabolic and trophic support for 
      axons and their disruption results in axonal demise and neurodegeneration, which are 
      key features of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Notably, the brain has a remarkable 
      capacity for regenerating oligodendrocytes, which is the function of adult 
      oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) or NG2-glia. White matter loss is 
      often among the earliest brain changes in AD, preceding the tangles and plaques that 
      characterize neuronal deficits. The underlying causes of myelin loss include 
      oxidative stress, neuroinflammation and excitotoxicity, associated with accumulation 
      of Aβ and tau hyperphosphorylation, pathological hallmarks of AD. Moreover, there is 
      evidence that NG2-glia are disrupted in AD, which may be associated with disruption 
      of synaptic signalling. This has led to the hypothesis that a vicious cycle of 
      myelin loss and failure of regeneration from NG2-glia plays a key role in AD. 
      Therapies that target NG2-glia are likely to have positive effects on myelination 
      and neuroprotection in AD.

AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is characterized by hypomyelination and neuronal loss. To 
      assess the basis for myelin loss in HD, we generated bipotential glial progenitor 
      cells (GPCs) from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) derived from mutant Huntingtin 
      (mHTT) embryos or normal controls and performed RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) to assess 
      mHTT-dependent changes in gene expression. In human GPCs (hGPCs) derived from 3 mHTT 
      hESC lines, transcription factors associated with glial differentiation and myelin 
      synthesis were sharply downregulated relative to normal hESC GPCs; NKX2.2, OLIG2, 
      SOX10, MYRF, and their downstream targets were all suppressed. Accordingly, when 
      mHTT hGPCs were transplanted into hypomyelinated shiverer mice, the resultant glial 
      chimeras were hypomyelinated; this defect could be rescued by forced expression of 
      SOX10 and MYRF by mHTT hGPCs. The mHTT hGPCs also manifested impaired astrocytic 
      differentiation and developed abnormal fiber architecture. White matter involution 
      in HD is thus a product of the cell-autonomous, mHTT-dependent suppression of glial 
      differentiation.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Microvascular brain injury (mVBI) is a common pathological correlate of 
      vascular contributions to cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID) that leads to 
      white matter (WM) injury (WMI). VCID appears to arise from chronic recurrent white 
      matter ischemia that triggers oxidative stress and an increase in total 
      oligodendrocyte lineage cells. We hypothesized that mVBI involves vasodilator 
      dysfunction of white matter penetrating arterioles and aberrant oligodendrocyte 
      progenitor cell (OPC) responses to WMI. METHODS: We analyzed cases of mVBI with low 
      Alzheimer's disease neuropathological change in prefrontal cortex WM from rapid 
      autopsies in a population-based cohort where VCID frequently occurs. Arteriolar 
      vasodilator function was quantified by videomicroscopy. OPC maturation was 
      quantified using lineage specific markers. RESULTS: Acetylcholine-mediated 
      arteriolar dilation in mVBI was significantly reduced in WM penetrators relative to 
      pial arterioles. Astrogliosis-defined WMI was positively associated with increased 
      OPCs and was negatively associated with decreased mature oligodendrocytes. 
      INTERPRETATION: Selectively impaired vasodilator function of WM penetrating 
      arterioles in mVBI occurs in association with aberrant differentiation of OPCs in 
      WMI, which supports that myelination disturbances in VCID are related to disrupted 
      maturation of myelinating oligodendrocytes. Ann Neurol 2018;83:142-152.

AB  - Glial cytoplasmic inclusions (GCIs), commonly observed as α-synuclein 
      (α-syn)-positive aggregates within oligodendrocytes, are the pathological hallmark 
      of multiple system atrophy. The origin of α-syn in GCIs is uncertain; there is 
      little evidence of endogenous α-syn expression in oligodendrocyte lineage cells, 
      oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs), and mature oligodendrocytes (OLGs). Here, 
      based on in vitro analysis using primary rat cell cultures, we elucidated that 
      preformed fibrils (PFFs) generated from recombinant human α-syn trigger 
      multimerization and an upsurge of endogenous α-syn in OPCs, which is attributable to 
      insufficient autophagic proteolysis. RNA-seq analysis of OPCs revealed that α-syn 
      PFFs interfered with the expression of proteins associated with neuromodulation and 
      myelination. Furthermore, we detected cytoplasmic α-syn inclusions in OLGs through 
      differentiation of OPCs pre-incubated with PFFs. Overall, our findings suggest the 
      possibility of endogenous α-syn accumulation in OPCs that contributes to GCI 
      formation and perturbation of neuronal/glial support in multiple system atrophy 
      brains.

AB  - A recent controlled trial has established that high-dose biotin supplementation - 
      100 mg, three times daily - has a stabilizing effect on progression of multiple 
      sclerosis (MS). Although this effect has been attributed to an optimization of 
      biotin's essential cofactor role in the brain, a case can be made that direct 
      stimulation of soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) by pharmacological concentrations of 
      biotin plays a key role in this regard. The utility of high-dose biotin in MS might 
      reflect an anti-inflammatory effect of cGMP on the cerebral microvasculature, as 
      well on oligodendrocyte differentiation and on Schwann cell production of 
      neurotrophic factors thought to have potential for managing MS. But biotin's ability 
      to boost cGMP synthesis in the brain may have broader neuroprotective potential. In 
      many types of neurons and neural cells, cGMP exerts neurotrophic-mimetic effects - 
      entailing activation of the PI3K-Akt and Ras-ERK pathways - that promote neuron 
      survival and plasticity. Hippocampal long term potentiation requires nitric oxide 
      synthesis, which in turn promotes an activating phosphorylation of CREB via a 
      pathway involving cGMP and protein kinase G (PKG). In Alzheimer's disease (AD), 
      amyloid beta suppresses this mechanism by inhibiting sGC activity; agents which 
      exert a countervailing effect by boosting cGMP levels tend to restore effective 
      long-term potentiation in rodent models of AD. Moreover, NO/cGMP suppresses amyloid 
      beta production within the brain by inhibiting expression of amyloid precursor 
      protein and BACE1. In conjunction with cGMP's ability to oppose neuron apoptosis, 
      these effects suggest that high-dose biotin might have potential for the prevention 
      and management of AD. cGMP also promotes neurogenesis, and may lessen stroke risk by 
      impeding atherogenesis and hypertrophic remodeling in the cerebral vasculature. The 
      neuroprotective potential of high-dose biotin likely could be boosted by concurrent 
      administration of brain-permeable phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors.

TI  - Pathogenesis of white matter changes in cerebral small vessel diseases: beyond 
      vessel-intrinsic mechanisms.
PG  - 635-651
LID - 10.1042/CS20160380 [doi]
AB  - Cerebral small vessel diseases (SVDs) are a leading cause of age and 
      hypertension-related stroke and dementia. The salient features of SVDs visible on 
      conventional brain magnetic resonance images include white matter hyperintensities 
      (WMHs) on T2-weighted images, small infarcts, macrohemorrhages, dilated perivascular 
      spaces, microbleeds and brain atrophy. Among these, WMHs are the most common and 
      often the earliest brain tissue changes. Moreover, over the past two decades, large 
      population- and patient-based studies have established the clinical importance of 
      WMHs, notably with respect to cognitive and motor disturbances. Here, we seek to 
      provide a new and critical look at the pathogenesis of SVD-associated white matter 
      (WM) changes. We first review our current knowledge of WM biology in the healthy 
      brain, and then consider the main clinical and pathological features of WM changes 
      in SVDs. The most widely held view is that SVD-associated WM lesions are caused by 
      chronic hypoperfusion, impaired cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR) or blood-brain 
      barrier (BBB) leakage. Here, we assess the arguments for and against each of these 
      mechanisms based on population, patient and experimental model studies, and further 
      discuss other potential mechanisms. Specifically, building on two recent seminal 
      studies that have uncovered an anatomical and functional relationship between 
      oligodendrocyte progenitor cells and blood vessels, we elaborate on how small vessel 
      changes might compromise myelin remodelling and cause WM degeneration. Finally, we 
      propose new directions for future studies on this hot research topic.

AB  - The extracellular matrix (ECM) is known to regulate important processes in neuronal 
      cell development, activity and growth. It is associated with the structural 
      stabilization of neuronal processes and synaptic contacts during the maturation of 
      the central nervous system. The remodeling of the ECM during both development and 
      after central nervous system injury has been shown to affect neuronal guidance, 
      synaptic plasticity and their regenerative responses. Particular interest has 
      focused on the inhibitory role of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs) and 
      their formation into dense lattice-like structures, termed perineuronal nets (PNNs), 
      which enwrap sub-populations of neurons and restrict plasticity. Recent studies in 
      mammalian systems have implicated CSPGs and PNNs in regulating and restricting 
      structural plasticity. The enzymatic degradation of CSPGs or destabilization of PNNs 
      has been shown to enhance neuronal activity and plasticity after central nervous 
      system injury. This review focuses on the role of the ECM, CSPGs and PNNs; and how 
      developmental and pharmacological manipulation of these structures have enhanced 
      neuronal plasticity and aided functional recovery in regeneration, stroke, and 
      amblyopia. In addition to CSPGs, this review also points to the functions and 
      potential therapeutic value of these and several other key ECM molecules in 
      epileptogenesis and dementia.

TI  - Early postnatal behavioral, cellular, and molecular changes in models of Huntington 
      disease are reversible by HDAC inhibition.
PG  - E8765-E8774
LID - 10.1073/pnas.1807962115 [doi]
AB  - Huntington disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder caused 
      by expanded CAG repeats in the huntingtin gene (HTT). Although mutant HTT is 
      expressed during embryonic development and throughout life, clinical HD usually 
      manifests later in adulthood. A number of studies document neurodevelopmental 
      changes associated with mutant HTT, but whether these are reversible under therapy 
      remains unclear. Here, we identify very early behavioral, molecular, and cellular 
      changes in preweaning transgenic HD rats and mice. Reduced ultrasonic vocalization, 
      loss of prepulse inhibition, and increased risk taking are accompanied by 
      disturbances of dopaminergic regulation in vivo, reduced neuronal differentiation 
      capacity in subventricular zone stem/progenitor cells, and impaired neuronal and 
      oligodendrocyte differentiation of mouse embryo-derived neural stem cells in vitro. 
      Interventional treatment of this early phenotype with the histone deacetylase 
      inhibitor (HDACi) LBH589 led to significant improvement in behavioral changes and 
      markers of dopaminergic neurotransmission and complete reversal of aberrant neuronal 
      differentiation in vitro and in vivo. Our data support the notion that 
      neurodevelopmental changes contribute to the prodromal phase of HD and that early, 
      presymptomatic intervention using HDACi may represent a promising novel treatment 
      approach for HD.

TI  - Reversal of endothelial dysfunction reduces white matter vulnerability in cerebral 
      small vessel disease in rats.
LID - eaam9507 [pii]

AB  - Dementia is a major social and economic problem for our aging population. One of the 
      most common of dementia in the elderly is cerebral small vessel disease (SVD). 
      Magnetic resonance scans of SVD patients typically show white matter abnormalities, 
      but we do not understand the mechanistic pathological link between blood vessels and 
      white matter myelin damage. Hypertension is suggested as the cause of sporadic SVD, 
      but a recent alternative hypothesis invokes dysfunction of the blood-brain barrier 
      as the primary cause. In a rat model of SVD, we show that endothelial cell (EC) 
      dysfunction is the first change in development of the disease. Dysfunctional ECs 
      secrete heat shock protein 90α, which blocks oligodendroglial differentiation, 
      contributing to impaired myelination. Treatment with EC-stabilizing drugs reversed 
      these EC and oligodendroglial pathologies in the rat model. EC and oligodendroglial 
      dysfunction were also observed in humans with early, asymptomatic SVD pathology. We 
      identified a loss-of-function mutation in ATPase11B, which caused the EC dysfunction 
      in the rat SVD model, and a single-nucleotide polymorphism in ATPase11B that was 
      associated with white matter abnormalities in humans with SVD. We show that EC 
      dysfunction is a cause of SVD white matter vulnerability and provide a therapeutic 
      strategy to treat and reverse SVD in the rat model, which may also be of relevance 
      to human SVD.

TI  - Pericyte-derived bone morphogenetic protein 4 underlies white matter damage after 
      chronic hypoperfusion.
PG  - 521-535
LID - 10.1111/bpa.12523 [doi]
AB  - Subcortical small vessel disease (SVD) is characterized by white matter damage 
      resulting from arteriolosclerosis and chronic hypoperfusion. Transforming growth 
      factor beta 1 (TGFB1) is dysregulated in the hereditary SVD, CARASIL (cerebral 
      autosomal recessive arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy). 
      However, very little is known about the role of the largest group in the TGFB 
      superfamily - the bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) - in SVD pathogenesis. The aim 
      of this study was to characterize signaling abnormalities of BMPs in sporadic SVD. 
      We examined immunostaining of TGFB1 and BMPs (BMP2/BMP4/BMP6/BMP7/BMP9) in a total 
      of 19 post-mortem human brain samples as follows: 7 SVD patients (4 males, 76-90 
      years old); 6 Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients (2 males, 67-93 years old) and 6 
      age-matched disease controls (3 males, 68-78 years old). We subsequently 
      investigated the effects of oxygen-glucose deprivation and BMP4 addition on cultured 
      cells. Furthermore, adult mice were subjected to chronic cerebral hypoperfusion 
      using bilateral common carotid artery stenosis, followed by continuous 
      intracerebroventricular infusion of the BMP antagonist, noggin. In the SVD cases, 
      BMP4 was highly expressed in white matter pericytes. Oxygen-glucose deprivation 
      induced BMP4 expression in cultured pericytes in vitro. Recombinant BMP4 increased 
      the number of cultured endothelial cells and pericytes and converted oligodendrocyte 
      precursor cells into astrocytes. Chronic cerebral hypoperfusion in vivo also 
      upregulated BMP4 with concomitant white matter astrogliogenesis and reduced 
      oligodendrocyte lineage cells, both of which were suppressed by 
      intracerebroventricular noggin infusion. Our findings suggest ischemic white matter 
      damage evolves in parallel with BMP4 upregulation in pericytes. BMP4 promotes 
      angiogenesis, but induces astrogliogenesis at the expense of oligodendrocyte 
      precursor cell proliferation and maturation, thereby aggravating white matter 
      damage. This may explain white matter vulnerability to chronic hypoperfusion. The 
      regulation of BMP4 signaling is a potential therapeutic strategy for treating SVD.

TI  - Phosphodiesterase III inhibition promotes differentiation and survival of 
      oligodendrocyte progenitors and enhances regeneration of ischemic white matter 
      lesions in the adult mammalian brain.
PG  - 299-310
LID - 10.1038/jcbfm.2009.210 [doi]
AB  - Vascular dementia is caused by blockage of blood supply to the brain, which causes 
      ischemia and subsequent lesions primarily in the white matter, a key characteristic 
      of the disease. In this study, we used a chronic cerebral hypoperfusion rat model to 
      show that the regeneration of white matter damaged by hypoperfusion is enhanced by 
      inhibiting phosphodiesterase III. A rat model of chronic cerebral hypoperfusion was 
      prepared by bilateral common carotid artery ligation. Performance at the Morris 
      water-maze task, immunohistochemistry for bromodeoxyuridine, as well as serial 
      neuronal and glial markers were analyzed until 28 days after hypoperfusion. There 
      was a significant increase in the number of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells in the 
      brains of patients with vascular dementia as well as in rats with cerebral 
      hypoperfusion. The oligodendrocyte progenitor cells subsequently underwent cell 
      death and the number of oligodendrocytes decreased. In the rat model, treatment with 
      a phosphodiesterase III inhibitor prevented cell death, markedly increased the 
      mature oligodendrocytes, and promoted restoration of white matter and recovery of 
      cognitive decline. These effects were cancelled by using protein kinase A/C 
      inhibitor in the phosphodiesterase III inhibitor group. The results of our study 
      indicate that the mammalian brain white matter tissue has the capacity to regenerate 
      after ischemic injury.

TI  - Dynamic changes in myelin aberrations and oligodendrocyte generation in chronic 
      amyloidosis in mice and men.
PG  - 273-86
LID - 10.1002/glia.22432 [doi]
AB  - Myelin loss is frequently observed in human Alzheimer's disease (AD) and may 
      constitute to AD-related cognitive decline. A potential source to repair myelin 
      defects are the oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) present in an adult brain. 
      However, until now, little is known about the reaction of these cells toward amyloid 
      plaque deposition neither in human AD patients nor in the appropriate mouse models. 
      Therefore, we analyzed cells of the oligodendrocyte lineage in a mouse model with 
      chronic plaque deposition (APPPS1 mice) and samples from human patients. In APPPS1 
      mice defects in myelin integrity and myelin amount were prevalent at 6 months of age 
      but normalized to control levels in 9-month-old mice. Concomitantly, we observed an 
      increase in the proliferation and differentiation of OPCs in the APPPS1 mice at this 
      specific time window (6-8 months) implying that improvements in myelin aberrations 
      may result from repair mechanisms mediated by OPCs. However, while we observed a 
      higher number of cells of the oligodendrocyte lineage (Olig2+ cells) in APPPS1 mice, 
      OLIG2+ cells were decreased in number in postmortem human AD cortex. Our data 
      demonstrate that oligodendrocyte progenitors specifically react to amyloid plaque 
      deposition in an AD-related mouse model as well as in human AD pathology, although 
      with distinct outcomes. Strikingly, possible repair mechanisms from newly generated 
      oligodendrocytes are evident in APPPS1 mice, whereas a similar reaction of 
      oligodendrocyte progenitors seems to be strongly limited in final stages of human AD 
      pathology.

TI  - notch3 is essential for oligodendrocyte development and vascular integrity in 
      zebrafish.
PG  - 1246-59
LID - 10.1242/dmm.012005 [doi]
AB  - Mutations in the human NOTCH3 gene cause CADASIL syndrome (cerebral autosomal 
      dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy). CADASIL is 
      an inherited small vessel disease characterized by diverse clinical manifestations 
      including vasculopathy, neurodegeneration and dementia. Here we report two mutations 
      in the zebrafish notch3 gene, one identified in a previous screen for mutations with 
      reduced expression of myelin basic protein (mbp) and another caused by a retroviral 
      insertion. Reduced mbp expression in notch3 mutant embryos is associated with fewer 
      oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs). Despite an early neurogenic phenotype, mbp 
      expression recovered at later developmental stages and some notch3 homozygous 
      mutants survived to adulthood. These mutants, as well as adult zebrafish carrying 
      both mutant alleles together, displayed a striking stress-associated accumulation of 
      blood in the head and fins. Histological analysis of mutant vessels revealed 
      vasculopathy, including: an enlargement (dilation) of vessels in the telencephalon 
      and fin, disorganization of the normal stereotyped arrangement of vessels in the 
      fin, and an apparent loss of arterial morphological structure. Expression of hey1, a 
      well-known transcriptional target of Notch signaling, was greatly reduced in notch3 
      mutant fins, suggesting that Notch3 acts via a canonical Notch signaling pathway to 
      promote normal vessel structure. Ultrastructural analysis confirmed the presence of 
      dilated vessels in notch3 mutant fins and revealed that the vessel walls of presumed 
      arteries showed signs of deterioration. Gaps in the arterial wall and the presence 
      of blood cells outside of vessels in mutants indicated that compromised vessel 
      structure led to hemorrhage. In notch3 heterozygotes, we found elevated expression 
      of both notch3 itself and target genes, indicating that specific alterations in gene 
      expression due to partial loss of Notch3 function might contribute to the 
      abnormalities observed in heterozygous larvae and adults. Our analysis of zebrafish 
      notch3 mutants indicates that Notch3 regulates OPC development and mbp gene 
      expression in larvae, and maintains vascular integrity in adults.

      Abeta or by unknown materials in AD brain to make neurons or progenitor cells 
      regenerative. However, these responses and alterations might not be sufficient to 
      replace neuronal loss, but rather might act as an effecter of cell death. For 
      instance, downregulation of growth inhibitory factor/metallothionein-III and 
      upregulation of MAP1B result in both neurite sprouting and neuronal death. The 
      deteriorative regulation of Mash1 and Olig2 by Abeta also leads to differentiation 
      and death of progenitor cells. Clarifying the cell death mechanism accompanied with 
      regenerative responses might be necessary for repairing the nervous system or 
      slowing disease progression in AD.

AB  - Brain white matter lesions (WMLs), which are often observed in patients with 
      ischemic cerebrovascular diseases, contribute to cognitive decline. We analyzed the 
      pathologic and regenerative processes in brain white matter lesions of patients 
      diagnosed with vascular dementia. There was a significant increase in the number of 
      oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) in the brains of patients with vascular 
      dementia as well as in rats with cerebral hypoperfusion. WMLs can be induced 
      experimentally by bilateral common carotid artery ligation (BCCAL) of rats to cause 
      chronic cerebral ischemia. After chronic cerebral hypoperfusion injury, oxygen free 
      radicals and activated microglia acting as inflammatory elements contribute to 
      chronic cerebral hypoperfusion-induced WMLs. The cell death of oligodendrocytes 
      (OLGs) contributes directly to WMLs. The activation for intracellular signaling 
      pathway of cAMP responsive element binding protein (CREB) phosphorylation in the 
      white matter was suppressed after BCCAL. Type III phosphodiesterase inhibitor 
      (PDE3-I) has potential therapeutic and brain-protective effects based on multitarget 
      mechanism through cell signaling pathway of CREB phosphorylation. The OPCs 
      subsequently underwent cell death and the number of OLGs decreased. In the rat 
      model, PDE3-I prevented cell death, markedly increased the mature OLGs, and promoted 
      restoration of white matter and recovery of cognitive decline.

TI  - A novel population of progenitor cells expressing cannabinoid receptors in the 
      subependymal layer of the adult normal and Huntington's disease human brain.
PG  - 210-5
AB  - Progenitor cells in the adult human brain subependymal layer are capable of 
      producing new neurons and glial cells that may be useful as a source of cells for 
      endogenous cell replacement for regions of the brain that undergo degeneration due 
      to a neurodegenerative disease such as Huntington's disease, Parkinson's disease or 
      Alzheimer's disease. We have previously demonstrated that in the human Huntington's 
      disease brain there are increased numbers of progenitor cells proportional to the 
      severity of the gene defect responsible for the disease and proportional to the 
      severity of the pathology of the disease. One of the criticisms of a potential 
      endogenous progenitor cell replacement therapy has been that the endogenous 
      progenitor cells also contain the Huntington's disease gene and would therefore be 
      just as susceptible to degeneration as those in the degenerate brain region. In the 
      present study we have demonstrated the presence of cannabinoid CB1 receptors, which 
      are preferentially lost in Huntington's disease, colocalised with the proliferative 
      marker PCNA in the adult normal and Huntington's disease subependymal layer. This 
      population of CB1 positive cells only colabels with PCNA and not with neuronal, 
      glial, microglial or oligodendrocyte markers. These results indicate that the 
      subependymal layer in Huntington's disease contains a subpopulation of proliferating 
      cells that are also CB1 receptor positive and are thus not immediately susceptible 
      to the neurodegenerative process that denudes the striatum of CB1 receptors. This 
      finding raises the intriguing possibility that these cells could provide a suitable 
      source of cells for the endogenous replacement of cells lost due to 
      neurodegenerative disease.

TI  - Nogo receptor blockade overcomes remyelination failure after white matter stroke and 
      stimulates functional recovery in aged mice.
PG  - E8453-E8462
LID - 10.1073/pnas.1615322113 [doi]
AB  - White matter stroke is a distinct stroke subtype, accounting for up to 25% of stroke 
      and constituting the second leading cause of dementia. The biology of possible 
      tissue repair after white matter stroke has not been determined. In a mouse stroke 
      model, white matter ischemia causes focal damage and adjacent areas of axonal myelin 
      disruption and gliosis. In these areas of only partial damage, local white matter 
      progenitors respond to injury, as oligodendrocyte progenitors (OPCs) proliferate. 
      However, OPCs fail to mature into oligodendrocytes (OLs) even in regions of 
      demyelination with intact axons and instead divert into an astrocytic fate. Local 
      axonal sprouting occurs, producing an increase in unmyelinated fibers in the corpus 
      callosum. The OPC maturation block after white matter stroke is in part mediated via 
      Nogo receptor 1 (NgR1) signaling. In both aged and young adult mice, stroke induces 
      NgR1 ligands and down-regulates NgR1 inhibitors during the peak OPC maturation 
      block. Nogo ligands are also induced adjacent to human white matter stroke in 
      humans. A Nogo signaling blockade with an NgR1 antagonist administered after stroke 
      reduces the OPC astrocytic transformation and improves poststroke oligodendrogenesis 
      in mice. Notably, increased white matter repair in aged mice is translated into 
      significant poststroke motor recovery, even when NgR1 blockade is provided during 
      the chronic time points of injury. These data provide a perspective on the role of 
      NgR1 ligand function in OPC fate in the context of a specific and common type of 
      stroke and show that it is amenable to systemic intervention to promote recovery.

TI  - Higher levels of myelin phospholipids in brains of neuronal α-Synuclein transgenic 
      mice precede myelin loss.
PG  - 37

AB  - α-Synuclein is a protein involved in the pathogenesis of synucleinopathies, 
      including Parkinson's disease (PD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and multiple 
      system atrophy (MSA). We investigated the role of neuronal α-Syn in myelin 
      composition and abnormalities. The phospholipid content of purified myelin was 
      determined by (31)P NMR in two mouse lines modeling PD, PrP-A53T α-Syn and Thy-1 
      wt-α-Syn. Significantly higher levels of phospholipids were detected in myelin 
      purified from brains of these α-Syn transgenic mouse models than in control mice. 
      Nevertheless, myelin ultrastructure appeared intact. To further investigate the 
      effect of α-Syn on myelin abnormalities, we systematically analyzed the striatum, a 
      brain region associated with neurodegeneration in PD. An age and disease-dependent 
      loss of myelin basic protein (MBP) signal was detected by immunohistochemistry in 
      striatal striosomes (patches). The age-dependent loss of MBP signal was associated 
      with lower P25α levels in oligodendrocytes. In addition, we found that α-Syn 
      inhibited oligodendrocyte maturation and the formation of membranous sheets in 
      vitro. Based on these results we concluded that neuronal α-Syn is involved in the 
      regulation and/or maintenance of myelin phospholipid. However, axonal 
      hypomyelination in the PD models is evident only in progressive stages of the 
      disease and associated with α-Syn toxicity.

PG  - 9973-83

AB  - Tau protein in a hyperphosphorylated state makes up the intracellular inclusions of 
      several neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease and cases of 
      frontotemporal dementia. Mutations in Tau cause familial forms of frontotemporal 
      dementia, establishing that dysfunction of tau protein is sufficient to cause 
      neurodegeneration and dementia. Transgenic mice expressing human mutant tau in 
      neurons exhibit the essential features of tauopathies, including neurodegeneration 
      and abundant filaments composed of hyperphosphorylated tau. Here we show that a 
      previously described mouse line transgenic for human P301S tau exhibits an 
      age-related, layer-specific loss of superficial cortical neurons, similar to what 
      has been observed in human frontotemporal dementias. We also show that focal neural 
      precursor cell implantation, resulting in glial cell differentiation, leads to the 
      sustained rescue of cortical neurons. Together with evidence indicating that 
      astrocyte transplantation may be neuroprotective, our findings suggest a beneficial 
      role for glial cell-based repair in neurodegenerative diseases.

AB  - Plaque deposition in Alzheimer's disease (AD) is known to decrease proliferation in 
      neurogenic niches in AD mouse models, but the effects on cell proliferation and 
      differentiation in other brain areas have not been studied in detail. We analyzed 
      cell proliferation in the cortex of wild type (WT) and APPswePS1dE9 transgenic (AD) 
      mice at different ages. Mice were studied shortly after the last BrdU injection 
      (BrdU[ST]). In AD mice, the number of proliferating cells increased fourfold, 
      coinciding with plaque appearance and its associated reactive gliosis and activation 
      of microglia. An increase in the number of BrdU[ST]-cells expressing markers for 
      activated microglia is underlying the enhanced proliferation. Cortical reactive 
      astrocytes did not become proliferative since BrdU[ST]-cells were negative for 
      different astrocyte-specific markers. The number of Olig2-positive oligodendrocyte 
      precursor cells was unchanged. Four weeks after the last BrdU application, the 
      number of BrdU[LT]-cells with an activated microglia signature was still enhanced in 
      AD mice. None of the newborn cells had differentiated into oligodendrocytes, 
      astrocytes, or neurons. On the basis of these observations, we conclude that amyloid 
      plaque deposition increases proliferation of microglia around plaques but does not 
      affect the proliferation of cortical oligodendrocyte precursor cells. No evidence 
      was found for damage-induced proliferation of reactive astrocytes or for a 
      redirected neurogenesis from the subventricular zone. The proliferation of microglia 
      contributes to the rapid accumulation of microglia around plaques and may play a 
      role in limitating plaque expansion.

TI  - Early white matter abnormalities, progressive brain pathology and motor deficits in 
      a novel knock-in mouse model of Huntington's disease.
PG  - 2508-27
LID - 10.1093/hmg/ddv016 [doi]
AB  - White matter abnormalities have been reported in premanifest Huntington's disease 
      (HD) subjects before overt striatal neuronal loss, but whether the white matter 
      changes represent a necessary step towards further pathology and the underlying 
      mechanism of these changes remains unknown. Here, we characterized a novel knock-in 
      mouse model that expresses mouse HD gene homolog (Hdh) with extended CAG repeat- 
      HdhQ250, which was derived from the selective breeding of HdhQ150 mice. HdhQ250 mice 
      manifest an accelerated and robust phenotype compared with its parent line. HdhQ250 
      mice exhibit progressive motor deficits, reduction in striatal and cortical volume, 
      accumulation of mutant huntingtin aggregation, decreased levels of DARPP32 and BDNF 
      and altered striatal metabolites. The abnormalities detected in this mouse model are 
      reminiscent of several aspects of human HD. In addition, disturbed myelination was 
      evident in postnatal Day 14 HdhQ250 mouse brain, including reduced levels of myelin 
      regulatory factor and myelin basic protein, and decreased numbers of myelinated 
      axons in the corpus callosum. Thinner myelin sheaths, indicated by increased G-ratio 
      of myelin, were also detected in the corpus callosum of adult HdhQ250 mice. 
      Moreover, proliferation of oligodendrocyte precursor cells is altered by mutant 
      huntingtin both in vitro and in vivo. Our data indicate that this model is suitable 
      for understanding comprehensive pathogenesis of HD in white matter and gray matter 
      as well as developing therapeutics for HD.

TI  - Collapsin response mediator protein-2 phosphorylation promotes the reversible 
      retraction of oligodendrocyte processes in response to non-lethal oxidative stress.
PG  - 985-95
LID - 10.1111/j.1471-4159.2012.07742.x [doi]
AB  - The extension of processes of oligodendrocyte (OLG) and their precursor cells are 
      crucial for migration, axonal contact and myelination. Here we show that a 
      non-lethal oxidative stress induced by 3-nitropropionic acid (3-NP) elicited a rapid 
      shortening of processes (~24%) in primary OLGs and in oligodendroglial cell line 
      (OLN-93) cells (~36%) as compared with vehicle-exposed cells. This was reversible 
      and prevented by antioxidants. Proteomics of OLG lysates with and without 3-NP 
      treatment yielded collapsin response mediator protein 2 (CRMP-2) as a candidate 
      effector molecule. Inhibition of rho kinase was sufficient to prevent process 
      retraction in both OLGs and OLN-93 cells. Oxidative stress increased phosphorylation 
      of CRMP-2 at T555 that was completely prevented by Y27632. Moreover, transfection of 
      OLN-93 cells with the mutant CRMP-2 T555A which cannot be phosphorylated by rho 
      kinase, prevented process shortening induced by 3-NP as compared with wild-type 
      CRMP-2. Our results suggest a role for endogenous reactive oxygen species in a 
      pathway that regulates OLG process extension. The vulnerability of late myelinated 
      neurons in the adult brain and the presence of white matter pathology in human 
      dementias warrant the study of this oligodendroglial pathway in the early stages of 
      neurodegenerative conditions characterized by oxidative stress.

AB  - Immunization with an altered myelin-derived peptide (MOG45D) improves recovery from 
      acute CNS insults, partially via recruitment of monocyte-derived macrophages that 
      locally display a regulatory activity. Here, we investigated the local alterations 
      in the cellular and molecular immunological milieu associated with attenuation of 
      Alzheimer's disease-like pathology following immunotherapy. We found that 
      immunization of amyloid precursor protein/presenilin 1 double-transgenic mice with 
      MOG45D peptide, loaded on dendritic cells, led to a substantial reduction of 
      parenchymal and perivascular amyloid beta (Abeta)-plaque burden and soluble 
      Abeta((1-42)) peptide levels as well as reduced astrogliosis and levels of a key 
      glial scar protein (chondroitin sulphate proteoglycan). These changes were 
      associated with a shift in the local innate immune response, manifested by increased 
      Iba1+/CD45(high) macrophages that engulfed Abeta, reduced pro-inflammatory (tumor 
      necrosis factor-alpha) and increased anti-inflammatory (interleukin-10) cytokines, 
      as well as a significant increase in growth factors (IGF-1 and TGFbeta) in the 
      brain. Furthermore, the levels of matrix metalloproteinase-9, an enzyme shown to 
      degrade Abeta and is associated with glial scar formation, were significantly 
      elevated in the brain following immunization. Altogether, these results indicate 
      that boosting systemic immune cells leads to a local immunomodulation manifested by 
      elevated levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines and metalloproteinases that 
      contribute to ameliorating Alzheimer's disease pathology.
